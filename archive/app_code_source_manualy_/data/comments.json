    "comment_content": "NEVER TRUST EVERGREEN CREDIT UNION.  My ex wife was the target of a dental scam in a foreign country. She was coerced into signing a document agreeing to an evaluation, and coerced her into charging what she told was a nominal fee for the evaluation. Instead they charged her around $500 on the Evergreen account and instead of protecting us, this is what Evergreen said...\"Good morning Peter,I spoke with (ex-wife)  yesterday as you know, she told me that she found out after her visit that some of the services that dentist did were covered by her dental plan, and she believes she shouldn\u2019t have to pay them. I am sorry she had a bad experience with them, I recommended xxxx file a complaint against the dental office. I understand she may be apprehensive to go to the police, but if you are saying these aren\u2019t her signature this is now a legal matter.(Ex-wife) did mention reviews, reviews are not something we can use in disputes. At this time this case is closed.\"",

    "comment_content": "Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family. Kudos to Evergreen Credit Union for providing stellar customer service and showing just how much they care about their patrons!",

I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up. Overall not bad just slow on things I think should be addressed as being quicker.Thanks!",

It all came down when my daughter wanted a designed card, so I chalked up the $5 to get her a new card. I ordered the card on 1/22. It didn't come until 2/17, that's like 3 weeks. I've contacted customer service a bunch of time about the card taking forever and then I finally gave up and cancelled my account. I cancelled the account on 2/15 or 2/16 and I have yet to receive the money back on that account into my bank account. Never received a confirmation about cancelling my account, I just contacted customer service about it and I just feel like they give you the walk around.This company is highly unprofessional and basically steals your money. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Look into another kid friendly bank somewhere else!",

It looks like there has been a little miscommunication regarding how GoHenry works which has resulted in the service being temporarily suspended. I attempted to call you but I\u2019m afraid I was unable to reach you so I have sent you an email. Please can I kindly ask you to get back in touch with us or confirm a convenient time for us to give you another call? We would like the opportunity to work with you to turn this situation around and get your original query resolved if we possibly can. We are open 9am - 5pm EST 7 days a week.We look forward to hearing from you.Ella (GoHenry Supervisor)",

Our intended purpose is for children to learn key financial skills for any future financial responsibility.

As we are a financial service and not a bank, we don't operate in the same way and therefore cannot offer this type of interest that aligns with standard US bank accounts. I hope this continues to be a key supporter for your children in allowing them to be financially independent and stable in the future, and if you have any further queries please do contact us via our dedicated customer support lines - (877) 372-6466 / help@gohenrycard.com.

These will be very convenient for overnight trips or amusement park trips so I can monitor what they have spent and add money if needed without having to worry about them keeping track of enough cash for several days. I was very disappointed in how long it took for the cards to arrive. Cards arrived MUCH later than indicated when the order was placed and they do not track them, so they couldn't tell me if they were lost/stolen/delayed. The customer service rep(when I tried to contact them about the delayed cards) was very dismissive and not helpful.

If you follow the Dave Ramsey approach of spend/save/give, the GIVE option needs to be able to be much higher (based on their allowance). I'd like a large range of places to GIVE to...charities that would fit a child's interests and passions....animals, the environment, children's causes, schools, clean water...so many options, leading them to find something that they actually CARE about and WANT to donate to.We would like the option to change the debit card PIN number, just like an actual debit card from a bank. I'd like the option for the child to send money to me....to pay me back for a purchase made, or to be 'billed' if I need to 'hire' a sibling to do her chore, etc.",

Unfortunately I had to cancel immediately after activating this account because the address they had on file to verify me was an old address. I called the next day and they said well unfortunately we can\u2019t update it until you send us your driver\u2019s license but we\u2019ve already sent out the card. I asked if they could stop the card from being sent out since I no longer live at the address and they said no. Needless to say my son\u2019s card will be out there floating around at an old address because they refused to be proactive. I\u2019m super disappointed with my experience and I hardly ever leave bad reviews.",

I have managed to locate your account using the details provided and have attempted to call you to discuss the issues raised but was unable to reach you. I am disheartened to hear that you had issues with the address on your account, As a financial service provider, the U.S. Patriot Act requires us to ensure that we 'know our customer', so we use an online identification and address verification service to comply with this requirement, I would love to be able to assist with your issue as it seems we have two accounts set up with your details with different addresses and wanted to check which address you have on your license and how we can assist in successfully getting the card to you. I have also sent you a follow-up email with some additional information to your registered email address, Please may I ask that you review the email and advise of a more suitable time for us to contact you to discuss the points raised or you can give us a call on (877) 372-6466. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks Kay. - GoHenry Supervisor",

    "comment_content": "We love the this app and debit card system so far and the user experience is really high quality. I particularly like the way we can incorporate family members in the learning process and open the door for more thoughtful monetary gifts. I do, however, have a few suggestions to help make it even better for our family.1. Paced missions - once my son figured out that missions came with a monetary incentive, he became obsessed with finishing them and burned through them as fast as he could without taking much in. I wish the lessons were paced and tied to his activities and age. If the app stopped him from moving forward in his lessons until he reached a specific money milestone, he might be more receptive to the teachable moment. For example, he could be presented with a lesson on saving after a few months of using the app, along with with a challenge to start saving more. Basically, there should be prerequisites for unlocking additional lessons and they should use the interactions and age of the child to provide more guidance. For example, the lessons in the second stage were way above his head shouldn\u2019t have been available until he\u2019s within the recommended age range for them which shouldn\u2019t be difficult since the app knows he\u2019s 6. If anticipating the needs of so many different children is difficult, then  parents should have the option to lock milestones until they feel their child is ready for them. Then they could be part of an intentional process of parents guiding their kids through money lessons tied directly to lived experiences.2. I struggled a bit in setting up the allowance and tasks along with the allowance schedule. We first got the app on a Saturday and that is my son\u2019s allowance day. I couldn\u2019t get the app to send him his allowance same day and we had to wait a week to have it transfered based on his task activity. I wish there was a way to override the schedule at times and \u201cgive allowance now.\u201d Also, I wish we could look back at a calendar of previous allowances to reflect on his wins and challenges.3. Lastly I wish the giving section allowed us to identify a charity of our choice.",

In regards to the Allowances, I understand that you activated your account and set up this Allowance on a Saturday, which is the chosen Allowance day. As this was the day the account was created, the system would not have taken the Allowance into the hourly runs and therefore this is why it would have kicked in for the following Saturday. However for the feedback of the 'pay now' button, I have passed this on also.

Please may I ask if these are the payments you can see and can you check if these are funds going into your account rather than being debited?\u00a0I tried to call you today but I was unable to reach you and have left a voicemail, I have also sent you an email to your registered email address with some more information in reference to the account, If you could look out for that email. You can reply to the email or give us a call at (877) 372 6466. We are open 9am to 5pm ESTI look forward to hearing from you soon. Kay - GoHenry Supervisor",

Rather than dealing with these a big crypto sites that make it sound like they have it all together but offer no phone number and it takes forever to hear back with problems (I've dealt with many) - I'll take Crypto Dispensers anytime because even the owner, is hands on if there's any issues. Not only do they offer email from my account but also have a Customer Service phone number answered by a real HUMAN!  I have run into an issue or two but their Customer Service is very responsive and is on it, resolving the problem right away. I suggest you give them a try because they are so good that you'll never consider buying coin anyplace other than Crypto Dispensers! These people really care about their customers!",

It's been a few years since I last used them, I logged into my account today made a deposit and now I'm not able to withdraw any Bitcoin. Every time I try to send it out it just says failed, try again.  It's infuriating, there's so many other ways I could buy Bitcoin but this one was convenient at the time and now my money is just stuck. It's a shame because years ago I never had any issues like this.To top it off I can't get a hold of anybody, I can fill out a ticket which simply just sends a email saying they received it, the phone number does not work and there is no live chat. I have a feeling this is going to take a long time to get my money back.  So frustrating!!",

For 60 atms nationwide and in key retail establishments i did not expect any issues like being scammed but all these scam reviews are not looking promising. I may check onto cost of lawsuit too if not fixed. I have never had issue with any other company I have used except seeing small deposits stuck without a block for a time.",

Do not get involved with this company, they can\u2019t even perform the purchase and then they keep your money!!!! Stay away!!!Update: 9th day of not being able to buy Bitcoin or get my money back.

I must say this was the smoothest Bitcoin purchase by far with no hassles and no holdups. You choose deposit cash to account, they send you an email with a scannable barcode. Take that to the cashier and load anywhere from. $20-$500 as well as a $4.95 processing fee. The money was instantly on my account but took 15 min to clear. Then I purchased my Bitcoin and it sent to my wallet immediately and my wallet verified the deposit and is waiting for the blockchain to finalize it. Super simple and duper easy. The only bad thing I must say is $12 fee for a $120 purchase was a little steep but overall very easy and i will use this method from now on. Today is 3-11-21 and this is a real and truthful statement. My names Ryan from Palm Springs.",

So, I was never able to do the transaction.  It happened at both CVS and Rite Aid.  So I went and got a new account with another company and was able to buy the bite coins I needed to send.

    "comment_content": "Looking for the closest Bitcoin ATM I found several ads on Google for this company when I saw that they were tied to several major retailers. And so I thought this would be a safe bet I loaded the minimum amount which I'm glad they did offer a additional compensation for signing up and adding money which double the deposit.  But that's useless, because when you go to purchase the Bitcoin with your loaded funds, it fails, I've tried multiple addresses all tied to my social security number all verified, all normal coin base bitpay etc. And guess what? After filing a support ticket? I get a message back saying oh sorry, we're having a little issue with our bank. But don't worry your money safe. Why don't you go ahead and just wire us $2500? And we'll load that right away because you know you guys could manage $20. So why not just start a 2500? Are you absolutely f****** crazy?  This is not a good look, it's not that hard to put up a message that says Hey, this is what's going on. We're having an issue or working to resolve it instead, you trap people's money, which I'm sure the refund process isn't nearly as simple as giving you the money and I wonder where the money sits. Are there interests being made? Are you making money on my money? When you dishonestly and deceitfully took it? I think you probably are because you know that's what people do you sit on money? You make money.  So I call the customer service number and I get a nice receptionist who can't do s*** except give me a voicemail and so I am going to hope hit every review and then start finding complaints with regulatory agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau, the department of financial institutions, my State and the State that this business. Is licensed in respectively is Attorney General? The Better Business Bureau and anywhere else. I could possibly fit it in.  Cause this is not okay.I am a thorn and you're gonna feel it",

We take all customer concerns seriously and strive to provide a positive experience for all our users.Firstly, we want to clarify that we had a temporary issue that coincided with your first experience as a new user. Due to high demand and a system update, we temporarily ran out of available Bitcoins. This was not a deliberate attempt to inconvenience you, and we apologize for any misunderstanding. We are continuously working to improve our system and ensure a smoother experience for our users.The option to wire additional funds was offered to you as a means to facilitate your purchase separately from our CDReload service. We understand that it may have come across differently, and we're sorry if it caused any confusion. Our intention was to provide you with every available option to meet your needs.It's worth noting that even established services like Coinbase and Bitpay encounter occasional issues due to the complex nature of the cryptocurrency space. Human error can occur, and we appreciate your patience while we resolved the situation promptly.We would like to emphasize that your satisfaction is essential to us. We provided you with a bonus as a new user and resolved the issue within a reasonable timeframe. Furthermore, we offer customer support through various channels, including a dedicated phone line, to assist our users.Our service, CDReload, is designed to offer competitive rates and convenience, enabling users to add cash to their accounts at major retailers like CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, Casey's General Stores, and others.

    "comment_content": "I am updating a review that I wrote recently regarding Crypto Dispensers and their customer service. I received a phone call from the company on Tuesday, April 18. They explained to me about some issues they had been having with changes that they were having to make due to the recent economic upheavals and that they were trying to get everything taken care of and get my bitcoin sent out. I was encouraged to believe that I should have my bitcoin by the end of this past week. The call was helpful and amiable on both sides. At the end of the call I requested an email to be sent detailing all that had been discussed so that I would have it in writing. I was assured that I would receive an email that day and they requested my email address. As soon as the call was ended, I immediately sent my email address along with a nice note reminding them to please send me the statement of what had been discussed. A couple of hours later I received a text, assuring me once again that I would get an email that day. On Friday, after not having yet received the email, nor the bitcoin, I went back to the mall where I Initially deposited my money in the crypto dispensers ATM  and I spoke with the specialty leasing manager. She placed a call to crypto dispensers and was not able to reach anyone, but was forced to leave a message, which is what happens every time you call. She stated that they needed to get back with her for the issue to be solved that day. She also sent an email  stating the same thing. Today is the close of Saturday and I have not received the email, nor have I yet received my bitcoin. There has been no response whatsoever to any of our requests for communication.",

I\u2019d love to clarify the current process for in-app check deposit hold times.Once the deposit is made, it will then be reviewed within 1 business day. Once accepted, the deposit is made available in 2-5 business days. Factors that affect the speed with which your funds become available may include: the length and extent of your relationship with NorthOne, amount of historical transaction information, having a history of returned checks, and more. Please refer to NorthOne\u2019s Deposit Account Agreement, specifically section E.11, for more details on check deposit availability.I noticed that your deposit was initiated on 1/13, and the check will be available after the standard 5-business-day hold. It's worth noting that 1/15 was a Banking Holiday for MLK Day, which is treated as a non-business day. Since no money movement occurs on banking holidays, it might give the impression that the check is being held for an additional business day.Should you have any additional questions regarding your mobile check deposit, our Support Team is happy to clarify when a pending check will be made available in your Account.NorthOne Customer Care",

We are looking into methods of supporting this in the future, but in the meantime, we encourage customers to not send instant transfers through CashApp.Instead, when going through the flow in CashApp, the application will allow you to set up an instant transfer to your NorthOne card, however the funds will take the same amount of time as a standard transfer 1-3 business days and CashApp will still charge the instant fee.Because of this, we suggest linking your bank account instead of your card going forward, and only using the free standard transfer method to avoid incurring fees.As for loading cash on your card, NorthOne doesn\u2019t charge any fees for cash loads. The additional ATM fees you may experience are charged by 3rd party ATMs or ATM owners.We do apologize if your NorthOne experience so far is not what you had hoped for, but we are very open to your feedback and appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review. If there\u2019s anything else we can do for you or help you with, please let us know through our in-app chat or by emailing support@northone.com. We\u2019re happy to help. Thanks, NorthOne Customer Experience",

I have looked into your case specifically and see you have already chatted with our support team about this. As you know, deposits from Cash App, even instant ones, will take 1-3 business days to reflect in your NorthOne account.Currently, instant transfers are not supported using your NorthOne Mastercard\u00ae Debit Card. This, unfortunately, includes CashApp, Venmo, and Apple Pay. We have received lots of feedback about this and are actively looking into methods of supporting this in the future. In the meantime, while we develop an instant transfer feature, we would encourage you to not send instant transfers through CashApp.When going through the flow in CashApp, the application still allows you to set up an instant transfer to your NorthOne card, but the funds will take the same amount of time as a standard transfer (1-3 business days) and CashApp will still charge the instant fee.We suggest linking your bank account instead of your card, and only using the free standard transfer method to avoid incurring fees with CashApp.We certainly understand how this could cause an inconvenience and we do apologize for the trouble this may have caused you. Once we do have an instant transfer feature set up with some of our integrations, we will absolutely let all customers know.Thanks so much for your understanding.

    "comment_content": "I have been in business for almost 30 years, and when I decided to try an online bank which would connect with more of the modern day apps, I found NorthOne. Banking with them was a horrible mistake and I want to warn other businesses about putting your money with them.1. The first incident happened when they flagged my account for an unknown $1 payment from a Paypal account. They froze my account, which meant no money could come in or out. I was on vacation and it took me days to realize what happened. And it took weeks to get it fixed, because once the bank account was frozen, that sent a chain reaction to our merchant processing, vendors, etc... and the clean up and docs required to get everything going again, was insane.Again, all that happend, was we received $1 from a PayPal account, which was probably verifying our bank account and something we had set in motion. Something that any reasonable bank would have called us, sent a text and email, asking if we knew about the transaction. But not NorthOne, they just shut us down. This was the first incident.2. The next incident almost a year later, was when I noticed a $48 dollar Burger King charge on a virtual card we had never used. As the owner of a gym, that charge stood out becuase we don't eat there. I notified NorthOne, I verified that it was not us, they verified the virtual card had never been used before, and then they closed our bank account down. They didn't cancel that card, they just closed our account. Which meant we needed a new bank account yesterday, and every vendor, every utility and every payment on auto pay, which is everyone, was suddenly not being paid. If you have ever lost a card you know what a hassle it is to contact and update your new information to everyone. It takes days and hours upon hours of time. Which is why I didn't cancel this bank the first time. Because it is so time consuming to have to start anew.If you are considering this bank, don't. Eventually you will be sorry.",

I'd like to elaborate further here regarding the security of your Account and this process.I do see that the dispute for the unauthorized virtual card transaction is ongoing. As soon as there is an update on your dispute, you will be notified via email to your email on file.For additional context, when certain unauthorized transaction(s) occur on your Account, your Account is locked for your security. A review is then completed to make sure that there is no compromised information within your Account. This review was communicated on October 23rd, shortly before your Account was locked. When it was deemed that the Account would need to be closed due to compromised information, this was also communicated via email on October 24th once the review was completed. While the current dispute is still ongoing, you're able to re-apply for a new Account at any time by going to join.northone.com. Thank you for your understanding here. The most recent form of communication I see on my end from you is on November 16th, 2023.

They don't answer messages, tweets, Facebook comments, etc. Just today, I received an email stating they closed my account. I called Radius Bank, who is partnered with NorthOne, and they confirmed my account is still open, in good standing, and that I can still use my account. The rep on the phone also hinted at the fact that NorthOne is awful, but couldn't directly say it. How on earth can a \"bank\" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with \"updates\", and act like everything is fine. NorthOne can get bent. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Federal Reserve. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!Edit: Their reply to me is a fat lie. They have not communicated with me further than the initial email and conveniently chose to not address the fact that Radius Bank, their partner, even stated that my account is still active and not closed.

    "comment_content": "Their incompetence to approve mobile check deposits as it is incredible that a bank like this would take 7 business days to clear funds on a cashiers check from a reputable bank.01/09/24I did deposit a Cashiers Check from a reputable bank on 01/04/24, same day was advise via email the check was being processed. Next day was advised that check was approved and that was going to take 48 hours to be cleared, those 48 hours passed and contacted customer service via chat Monday 01/08/24 bank does not a physical office nor a customer service dept, direct phone number where you can call when you need to. Representative on the chat platform inform me the following:\"Check are in review for 48 hours and after that they could be released as early as the 3rd day, but this could go up to the maximum of 7 business days. Also, the more checks that are deposited in the Account, along with other factors, this timeline could shorten\".Going back and forth with this issue, I had to explain in different ways that 1) This is not a personal check but a Cashiers Ck. and funds had been already verified and withdrawn from clients bank account 2)Check was issued to my company and not an individual, and that my account has never had a returned check nor was to be put on hold as the account isn't red flagged for fraud. Went back and forth again via email with a Rep. that received an email from me where I explained what was going on and he was professional enough to advise that was going to relay this info to the \"Check Team' and see if they could do or assist on providing a more in depth explanation or solution to this issue. Never received an email from the Check Team letting me know what was the status of or if there was any possibility of a solution. Bottom line, I was told the Cashiers Check I deposited on January 4th, 2024 before noon, will be available on Thursday 11th, 2024 at the end of the day?  I am very disappointed and definitely ready to cancel the account I have with NorthOne. Bank isn't qualified to offer solutions to matters like this one nor offers the level of customer service satisfaction by going the extra mile on trying to resolve customers account concerns/issues/. As a business owner the above showed us that facts speak louder than words!.",

    "company_response_content": "Thank you for reaching out and I\u2019m sorry to hear about this frustrating experience. Certainly understand your irritations with the mobile deposit hold time. I\u2019d like to clarify how our mobile check deposit process works.With each mobile check deposit, it goes through a manual review to determine the hold time for that particular check. Checks deposited using the in-app Mobile Deposit service are generally made available within three business days from the day of deposit, but could take up to five to seven business days. In this case, I do see that this particular deposit is set to be made available five business days after the day of the deposit. Factors that affect the speed with which your funds become available may include: the length and extent of your relationship with NorthOne, amount of historical transaction information, having a history of returned checks, and more. I recommend reviewing our full terms for more insight into all factors that can be reviewed for an in-app mobile check deposit and its availability. You can reference section E.11 of NorthOne\u2019s\u00a0Deposit Account Agreement for a full breakdown on this.Thank you for your understanding here. If you have any further questions regarding this deposit, you can contact our Support team via in-app chat Support, Monday-Friday from 9:00am-6:00pm EST, or if you'd prefer, can schedule a phone call once logged into your Account.NorthOne Customer Care",

I am almost baffled they could have any good reviews, I would read all of the bad reviews very carefully before you decide to put a dime in NorthOne, you have been warned. I opened my account June of last year with $50.00, a couple days later my account was locked and I could not get it unlocked. I have sent three customer service emails to NorthOne with zero response except an automated email every couple of weeks. Since then the bank has basically deducted all $50.00 out of my account and is now going backwards $5.00 a day so now its overdrawn, I don't know how much cause I'm locked out, hopefully tens of thousands of dollars lol. Its now almost a year later and I still get emails from them but with no response to my concerns except to let me know my locked account is overdrawn, great business model guys, would have preferred if you just closed it like you did to some other people on here. This bank is a joke, it doesn't even have a working customer service number, thats really all you need to know...",

It seems that a couple of entrepreneurs decided to develop an online banking platform with Radius Bank providing the actual services. Interesting concept - but, it doesn't work. Customer service SUCKS. They closed my account by sending an email. No explanation except, \"The decision to exit your relationship is based on the overall evaluated risk, and not necessarily a reflect of you, or your account.We're sorry for the impact this decision may have on you, but the decision to close your account is final.Please do ensure you've transferred all your funds out of the account before April 13th, otherwise you will receive the remaining balance by check to your mailing address.\" Stay away from NorthOne.UPDATE - It took a few weeks for NorthOne to respond with the typical corporate message. I did absolutely nothing to deserve the closure of my account. These app developers have no clue what personalized customer service means. If they did care about customer service, someone would call me to explain why they closed my account. Instead, they have a lawyer and a public relations writer respond to my critical review. NorthOne is not worth your business.",

They are a financial technology company ...essentially an app. You cant call anyone, you have to make an appointment thru the app and generally appointments are not available the same day. I opened this account, made a cash deposit to open. Then made a check deposit to test the system out ( for hold times etc). They immediately rejected the check ( no reason given) -cash was fine thou- and locked the account! Now the cash deposit is not available for withdrawal. they sent an email to answer alot of questions about my business. People, one of the questions was how do we get clients? - are you kidding me!!? Um, none of your business. They charged the 10.00 fee immediately upon depositing the cash . This appears to be a scam to charge a fee. My guess is they will hold the cash deposit and will finish \"the review\" after they charge more fees against the cash deposit. I only deposited 100.00 cash - which is now frozen. Imagine if you deposited a larger amount and then they just decide to block the account and its next to impossible to speak to someone. STAY AWAY. or your money could be frozen for no apparent reason and then they will ask you to answer 100 questions ( personal questions) about your business. Almost like they would then use the info for other purposes. Very sketchy. NORTHONE I would suggest you unblock the account or you'll spend your time doing damage control on posts like these.",

Instead of this company calling me first to discuss the transactions they just froze my account all together. DO NOT COME TO THIS BANK!!!!! They charge you a $15 a month maintenance fee just as long as you're paying this fee they don't bother your account. But if you miss they make up an excuse to close your account. Don't waste your time on this account. So yes please close the account. I will never do business with this bank again. Its one thing to do an account audit but then to ask your consumer to provide all of their customer contracts is completely absurd. Thanks but no thanks. You can close it.

    "comment_content": "On Friday March 17th 2023 I was notified without any prior warning or notice that my business bank account had been suspended. My funds were frozen and I was locked out my account. I received an email from Northone stating \"We have decided to suspend your account until an account review is completed.\" I was told I needed to submit a questionnaire, invoices explaining my business, and information on my other bank accounts in order to continue to use their services. The bank had been fully aware of my line of business for more than a year after signing up and I operated my account the same way until this day. According to them this is something \"all financial services companies do\". No other bank has ever attempted this that I have dealt with. It was not until I threatened them with legal action that they immediately unlocked my account.Numerous payments that I had tied to my account were missed causing me to work over the weekend to rectify the situation and use my other bank accounts that I thankfully had for my business. Judging by complaints here on BBB this has happened recently to many of their customers. I have no desire to do business with this bank especially with their services being offered through the The Bancorp Bank Holding Company which is being sued by investors for similar liquidity issues that recently brought down Silicon Valley Bank.",

After having the account for a few weeks, I can no longer login and then I get an email saying the acct is under review on 8/27. Now 2 weeks later, the same scripted reply that the account is under review. No one with a business can tolerate blocked access to their business banking account for days, let alone weeks. I think that NorthOne is a functioning scam and the positive reviews can't be real at all.UPDATE: Its now 3 months later and not one word from NorthOne on the status of their review or my account. So this just further shows the kind of company NorthOne is. They have kept the account locked for over 3 months. They have failed to communicate anything to me, but they have no problem with spamming me with 3rd party deals. Any inquiry to them generates the same pre-made email about how the security of their customers is their primary concern, which is quite rich because it looks to me like their customers are inconsequential to them and they are only protecting themselves. What from, you ask? No way to know, they won't share any info with their \"customer\" a.k.a. guinea pig for whatever scam they are running. This is not a made-up review; everything I have said is based on exactly what they have done. If you care about your money, get as far away from NorthOne as possible!",

Ya'll is pathetic stilling people money and putting in your pocket.

I didn't like the services and the lack support and perks they offered so I asked them to stop charging me per month and close my account at this point.They instead have continued to charge me per month and have drained the account even though I asked to to stop and close my account. There customer support is practically non existent and it feels as if they are trained to avoid you instead of help you. Imagine that!!!  I have been trying to reach customer service through their online chat portal and have no luck. It takes an hour to get connected then to send one message. I also looked for their phone support and have gotten nowhere. Nonexistent!They are so beyond ridiculous and deserve negative starts not even one star. I expect them to read this and fix this terrible experience or I will file a complain and not just a review.:This is a follow up edit on the review after NorthOne decided to respond.:I clearly asked on April 29th to stop getting charged fees. I did not receive any reply or help for that request. NorthOne are conveniently making themselves seem like they did the right thing and I have emails showing that to be a lie. Nice try but I stand by my review and am disgusted by NorthOne services and lies. Be ashamed of yourselves. This follow up response is a joke just like your terrible lack of customer support and your extravagant ways of wasting consumers precious time.

I see that you reached out to our team on April 29th, one month after opening your account, on March 29th, about being charged the first monthly fee, of which is agreed upon paying when you sign up. Our team let you know that this fee is standard and you did not continue the conversation. You reached out again June 24th stating you never got a reply and that your card came very late after sign up, when our team comfirmed with you that the card was activated 5 business days after account opening, as expected. During this outreach you shared that you wanted to close your account, at which point our team closed it for you. However, the fees already incurred would not be returned, as agreed upon in your signup.I also understand you mention it was difficult to get ahold of our team, however our typical response time during business hours is less than 10 min to get a reply and we are open 7 days a week to assist customers via chat and email. You can also schedule a call 7 days a week through your NorthOne application. We do value customer communications and each time you reached out, our team was able to respond, though often times our responses went unread or replied to by you which is why your account was not closed sooner. I understand that this may not be the response you want, but we appreciate your understanding.  ",

    "comment_content": "I recant my previous negative review. NorthOne were prompt in their response to my concerns in inquiry. They have been patient and professional. My account was set quickly after a few more inquiries. I still feel that should have a customer service number for inquiring potential customers. But, they were so quick to respond to my concerns that maybe they don't?  I've changed my reviews from 1 star to 5.---------------------------------------------------I applied with two different online business banks, and one of them was NorthOne. I never heard back from them until I attempted to login to check and see if I could find out the status. Once logged in, they directed me to the option to make a deposit. So maybe they did approve my account?? I went through the deposit process and got the message that they needed to verify more information and that should be completed in 24 hours. That took 3 additional days.They have a number (332) 205-9253, and when you call it, it tells you to either make an appointment with a customer rep or email customer service.  I emailed them, and long story short, because my email wasn't the same as the one I applied with, they couldn't answer any questions. I explained the email that applied with was an alias to my business email address, and that I'd be happy to provide any other information they needed, or can I please talk to someone.  I was told the number is for customers only and that I need to email them from the email address that I applied for the account with.  I was frustrated. First, I waited days to get a reply. Then, when I logged in, I found that they were ready for me to go to the next step which was make a deposit -- only to be told that I will need to wait an additional 24 hours for whatever else they needed to verify... The 24 hours turned into 72. So, I needed to call my hosting company to get my email name changed, which I did. convoluted Once I did that, I called and requested they terminate the application.

    "comment_content": "My account has been locked for 48 hours. I have not been able to talk to a person nor gotten any responses to the 8 emails I have sent to \"customer support\" I DO NOT recommend trusting NorthOne with your small business banking. I will never use an online only bank again. Its been a terrible experience and not worth $15/month in banks fees I was going to save. If you want access to your funds DO NOT trust NorthOne with them. They are liars, they replied once on Facebook that they emailed me. I guess its somewhat true I got 4 emails asking me to refer new customers to them. But 0 emails or communication regarding my locked account or their outright ignoring me for 48 hours. They will steal your money for no reason and ignore your attempts to contact them. On a side note its probably not great marketing to ask for referrals from someone you just stole money from and are now ignoring. But I did listen and have been giving feedback about how they stole my money are now ignoring me to anyone looking for a new bank. **** I deposited a business check from a fortune 500 company into my business checking account. 5 days after locking account they now want me to prove that check was actually paid to me. They want invoices, They asked how I got the check, like did I find it and randomly try cashing it? It's written to my business from a business there is no suspicious activity. Yet they come at me as though I stole the check and am cashing a check that isn't mine. More so than ever I believe NorthOne is a scam and out to hurt small business. DO NOT trust them with your money. I have no idea how long it will take me to prove my businesses money is mine and get it back. They will ignore you and make you jump through circus hoops to prove your money is yours.***** I still do not recommend NorthOne, my entire experience was terrible and their random locking of accounts for illegitimate and illegal reasons can destroy a small business. I received my check for the funds in my were in my account via 2 day UPS so they can get your money back to you in a timely manner. If you make enough noise. I commented on the CEO's linkedin page and posted public comments on facebook posts to finally get them responding to me. I promised to continue commenting publicly until I had my money returned.",

    "comment_content": "So I\u2019m an online marketer/freelancer that partakes and earns income from multiple opportunities online, referring to family/friends. I joined this app a few days ago to use and refer to others as well; they were running a $75 referral bonus for each successful person who signs up and deposits $50. So I joined and followed those instructions and received a few sign ups. Then the next day I was emailed that my account was suspended til I could provide documentation about my business and answer some of their questions. Inconvenience considering my account was accepted already, but I did as they requested and provided my information, answered their questions, and sent payment proof that I do earn income online from my business and sent some social media links so they could see exactly what it is I do (even though I did explain) Fast forward to Today, my account is closed & I can\u2019t access the app/login and the person I\u2019ve been speaking to hasn\u2019t provided me any legitimate reason as to WHY my account was closed. Like she doesn\u2019t care; I had to mention I was going to the BBB (which I am) if I don\u2019t receive my money! Only then after mentioning that, did she say they would mail me a check! I\u2019m awaiting her response as of now\u2026 not sure if the check is only for my deposit or for my sign on bonus/referral pay as well. Because she didn\u2019t mention so. Support is BAD. (At least with this woman it is) Us marketers know each other, we talk. This is unfair treatment, sketchy, stealing, & bad business. We did the work; least they could do is honor their referral program and pay us. So that\u2019s why I give NorthOne Bank a 1 star.UPDATE 11/12/2021, after NorthOne\u2019s reply: I received the exact same response from y\u2019all that other\u2019s have received; y\u2019all have provided no additional info, simply copying & pasting scripts to everyone to make yourself seem professional, however still not answering our concerns as to why y\u2019all are shutting down accounts left & right and not paying people what\u2019s due to them; this is not good business! (PS, that link\u2026 yall modified last week AFTER I & others joined\u2026 stating, \u201cyou can refer to close, personal family and friends only\u201d which is what I do!) So either way, I followed your rules, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t wanna honor your own referral program! That\u2019s sad. Y\u2019all \u2018tricked\u2019 a bunch of people, including myself, into joining & depositing $50 and then turn around and suspend & eventually shut down our accounts, AFTER we submit to y\u2019all personal/sensitive info like our driver\u2019s license and ssn! If that\u2019s not suspicious I don\u2019t know what is. Also! Y\u2019all claim to have sent me a check (which I have not received & I\u2019m still waiting on) And y\u2019all haven\u2019t even responded back to my email where I request a photo copy of the check (cause I wasn\u2019t told how much the check would be for) and tracking. ? So I can send y\u2019all details that y\u2019all claim you need to help reinstate my account (tho y\u2019all closed it)!! but y\u2019all can\u2019t send me proof of sending my check? What BS. Seems one sided, don\u2019t it? (For anyone reading this) I do NOT recommend trying NorthOne. Most people, including myself, are displeased!- I did file a claim with the BBB.",

    "comment_content": "Based on my experience thus far, NorthOne is shady, at best, and a total fraud, at worst. I signed up thinking this would be a great banking app for my marketing needs. Deposited $50 and a few hours later, they suspended my account. Asked me to provide supporting documentation, which I did. Today, they closed my account with no reason as to why. They haven't responded to my replies, and it appears they're attempting to keep my $50 deposit as there was no mention of returning it to me in their correspondence. I also acquired referral signups but they appear not to be honoring those, either.Update after NorthOne's reply: I've received this same canned response AFTER I made several attempts to find out why they pulled a \"bait and switch\" routine. NorthOne has offered nothing new in this canned reply. In fact, they offered even less today. In their replies to me after I repeatedly asked them for an explanation, they refused to give me specifics as to why they closed my account after accepting my deposit and approving my account. They sent me a link to their referral terms/conditions, which they just modified last week to state \"you can refer to close, personal friends and family only.\" Meanwhile, NorthOne advertises their signup/referral bonuses on sites such as Swagbucks, so there's no reason to believe that referring their promotion is something they did not want. What's clear is that NorthOne DID NOT want to honor their signup or referral bonus offerings, as they duped countless people - myself included - into applying for an account and depositing $50, and then suspended and closed the accounts.. Meanwhile, they now have copies of my driver's license, my SSN and other sensitive information.NorthOne claims to have sent me a check after I repeatedly inquired about it. I asked for proof of this and they have yet to provide me any proof, and I have still not received a check.Update 11/17/21 - It's been 8 days since NorthOne told me they were sending me a check to refund the $50 I deposited when signing up. I haven't received the check, and I asked about it this morning, to which \"Paulie\" replied, \"we advise that you please review the Account Agreement from here.\"Update 5/31/22 - I finally received my check weeks after having to demand it from Northone.  I truly believe they would've kept my deposit had I not fought tooth-and-nail to get it back.  I also found that my original review back in November was removed, and they've got several suspicious 5-star reviews which I believe are from employees.  There's also one 3-star review and their reply encouraged the reviewer to change it to 5-star.  Shady and desperate.  Despite them seemingly trying to stack the deck with fake 5-star reviews, the 1-star genuine reviews are still coming in on this company's shady business practices.Based on my experience, I strongly warn against doing business with this awful company.Update 6/4/22 - The reply they gave to this is the same canned reply they gave on my original review, which they somehow got removed, hence this re-review.  I spent weeks going back and forth with them via email.  Out of all the people I spoke to, there was only one rep who was actually apologetic over the situation and professional.  All the others were as ridiculous as their reply to this review is.",

    "comment_content": "I signed up for NorthOne about a month ago.  All was going well until I was notified one day that my referral link had been removed and more information was requested about my business.  Confused about this I replied back to NorthOne that I had already provided the requested information during sign up and was only told, \"All banks occasionally review customer accounts...\".  I still found this odd, but complied with their request and provided the requested information the next day.  After I provided the information, I was told \"Your referral link has been removed and will not be reactivated\" in spite of me providing everything they asked for.  When I inquired why I was being treated with such disdain and accusatory nature, the support only replied that they could not tell me why my link was revoked, and simply referred me to their terms of service.  I read over the terms and nothing in them applied to me in any way.  This occurred after I referred two people who are also small business owners to the bank.  It appears they removed my link so that they would not have to pay the referral bonuses.  Having not broke ANY of their rules or terms this is the only logical explanation. I've never in my life seen such scamming tactics utilized by a legitimate bank.  It's shameful.edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I feel slightly better to know that I wasn't singled out and that  NorthOne is just an awful scam ridden bank.  I find it amusing they have this canned response:\"All financial service companies are required to evaluate their products, services and customers periodically.\" (I also received this response when engaging with customer service via email).My Lili small business banking account has never treated me this way so they can keep this awful canned response to themselves.",

They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested).  I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.Bottom line:  I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again.

She says no, I don't see a problem with it. So I reborrow, after paying. Next month comes and a different girl calls and says I am down to pay that day. I said I don't get my check till the first and the 3rd. She says we'll the 3rd is 4 days out. I said well I get a check the first also and that is 2 days out. She says well your check may be here when you come or it may not be. I said well do what ever you have to but I don't get paid till the first and 3rd. Can come in the first. So today I look at my bank account and sure enough she had turned it in and it's pending. I don't care mind you but the other girl had told me it would be fine. This dark haired girl that called me has always been so hateful. I always avoid having to deal with her and always go to the other register. The black haired girl is a very pretty girl but her attitude and personality and hatefulness does not go with her beauty. But how is one worker saying one thing and another worker saying another helping at all. I been going there for a few years. I will be finding another location.  I will go to the one on Main Street. Evidently paying early makes a whole lot of difference.",

I fixed the numbers that I had mixed up on my application for him to tell me that they\u2019ll get back but the end of the month is busy for \u201cnew applications only\u201d so I may not hear back as quickly as my first application\u2026fine no big deal.

Instead it is someone else's wallet address and they have taken my deposit and handed it out to a dozen other addresses. I have threatened to sue them and I still don't hear anything from them. Run away, do not use them unless you feel like gambling and don't mind losing",

Coin cloud stated that the machine wasn't profitable and was very rude over the phone.  I told them to come get the equipment and pay me the money owed.

I emailed coin cloud but received no response and then today, I wasn\u2019t thinking and used their atm again.  It was only 100 bucks but again, I have received no message regarding my transaction so I have no clue if or when it will show up in my wallet. No notice on the screen of delayed times or anything.

    "comment_content": "First of all I've used coincloud machines before and their rates are kind of ridiculously high and service is usually slower than any other Bitcoin ATM, but I used them again yesterday at 4A.M. I sent 40.00 in Bitcoin to an address and here we are 12:27a.m. the next day and still I have not received my Bitcoin. My Girlfriend also sent 40.00 right after me and she still haven't received her Bitcoin either. This is beyond ridiculous. How are they still in business? I called customer service and was told I should receive my Bitcoin later today sometime, no particular time frame or anything just later today sometime. This seems like straight robbery to me. How do you pay the highest rates for the slowest service that is so backwards to me. If you need your Bitcoin sent at a reasonable time like that day in particular, I don't recommend using coin cloud unless you have a couple days to spare and your not worried about time and don't mind spending extra money to wait.",

I'm now waiting 2 hours I still don't have them in my wallet.(could have purchased them online with my debit card and literally had them in my wallet within 5 minutes) (why I didn't just do that like always I have no idea) (I think I just wanted to test out one of the ATMs and see what they were like) (I was also supposed to have a 25% off code and I entered it and it refused to take it even though it came directly from their website)On top of that no matter how much you buy you have to go through this absurd verification procedure with your driver's license and pictures. Completely off the wall.It's no wonder store owners around here are taking out there ATMs and putting in their competitors.I feel like an idiot that I just didn't go online and use an online exchange and pay a five or seven percent premium as opposed to what's turning out to be a 50% premium (assuming I actually ever get my freaking coins)I call in to see where my coins are in the ladies literally said to me what is bitcoin cash?Like what are you talking about I gave you a Bitcoin cash address and I chose altcoins and your receipt even says you're sending me Bitcoin cash.She says to me oh I didn't know our wallet is Bitcoin so we have to go buy them and send them to you so it could take a few hours.I would highly recommend you avoid using this company.",

    "comment_content": "Coincloud use to be the \"only\" bitcoin atm machine in my area. Now there's several different brands. Some have lower fees some have higher. As \"most\" people are aware, processing times are \"mostly\" determined by the blockchain. Within the last 18mos or longer regardless of either atm my funds are \"normally\" confirmed within 30mins or less. Earlier today I purchased using Coincloud atm, I recieved a txt saying it \"will\" be confirmed in appr. 47mins. It is going on 9hrs and still no confirmation. I have spoken with Customer Service twice since.The 1st thing they will tell you \"regardless\" of your reason to call is:1. It can take up to 24hrs2. It depends on hw busy the blockchain is which is true to a certain degree.What they \"wont\" tell u is 1. Coincloud Atm machines have not been operating smoothly within the last year or so. 2. Your wait time is \"NOT\" because of the \"normal\" processing times but because of a technical glitch in there systems. Who buys bitcoin expecting it not to be processed til the nxt day? They are trained to tell you a bunch of bs that doesn't make sense. Try asking to speak to a manager or supervisor and see how far that takes you. THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN UPPER MANAGEMENT. Which moreso pisses me off. This isnt my 1st time having UNUSUALLY LONG PROCESSING TIMES ALONG WITH HIGHER THAN NORMAL FEES but I can assure you Mr. Coincloud, it'll be my last. For those looking for LOWER fees and FAST confirmations w/o having to use a dam code try Googling COINFLIP ATMS in your area, they're in \"most\" 7/11 convenience stores and most Pittstop gas stations.Coincloud has proven to me once again that my business isn't valued. I'd rather pay a higher fee and wait 48hrs versus using a dam code because there fees are 2dam high and not owning up that their machines are not working properly. Ez fix, ADMIT your errors and do WHATEVER you need to do to keep from losing a customer. (I will be copy pasting this post everywhere I can).Thanks for reading.*AND AS FOR YOUR REPLY WISHING ME THE BEST OF LUCK, IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LUCK WITH YOUR UNEDUCATED CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AND RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FEES THAT YOU BLAME ON MINERS, NOT TO MENTION THE 10HOUR PROCESSING TIMES THAT YOU BLAME ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. THIS POST IS ONLY INTENDED TO MAKE PEOPLE FULLY AWARE WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT USING YOUR WALLET OR YOUR ATM. * My apologies if it seems as if you've read this post before, you probably have, I'm doing my best to repost this everywhere including ALL social media platforms.

    "comment_content": "Absolutely awful experience. And I\u2019ve not once taken the time to write a negative review for any company or service because I\u2019m pretty lenient, and like to think of everyone as human and capable of mistakes. But this place needs to get their s**t together. Seems like most reviews show they\u2019ve had bad experiences buying bitcoin, well I\u2019ve had a pretty bad one trying to sell mine for cash. After searching online for hours which ATM allows you to SELL bitcoin, I came across these guys. Went to a kiosk, and tried to sell $1000 worth of bitcoin. Everything looked good, it gave me a QR code to send the BTC to, and after I sent it I received a link to my phone to track the status. Went and sat in my car for about 30 mins til the BTC transaction was fully confirmed, then got a text saying the cash was ready for pickup and to go back to the kiosk. Went back, and was told by the kiosk screen they can\u2019t complete the transaction because the kiosk doesn\u2019t have the cash available. OH COOL, so there isn\u2019t a system in place to prevent me from starting a transaction that they can\u2019t fulfill? Weird. Anyways\u2026. The kiosk then gives me a drop down menu of other kiosks in the area that have the available cash, so it \u201ctransfers\u201d the transaction to the other kiosk I choose. Found one that was 20 minutes away\u2026 so I chose that one. I drive there, excited to finally finish this mess. Guess what? Same error! You\u2019ve got to be sh*tting me. No cash in the machine. It gives me the same prompt \u201cplease select another location\u201d. Unfortunately now the nearest location is further away, about 35 minutes backwards from where I live\u2026 so I call their support team and explain the issue. I said \u201clisten, I only want to drive to this other location if you can absolutely guarantee me that this kiosk actually has the funds to give me\u201d. They assured me it did and that it\u2019s rare for a machine to not have the available cash. Funny cause it already happened twice. Before I leave, silly me decides to try another transaction for $500, hopeful that maybe the machine was maybe short in cash but had enough to do $500. I sent the btc and get the same error even after it does tell me it has enough cash to complete the $500. Now I\u2019ve got $1500 missing and need to recover. Anyways, I take the drive, finally get there, and I get another similar BS error. Tried twice just to make sure it wasn\u2019t an error with my phone. Nope, sure enough their system is just really whack and yet again it doesn\u2019t have the cash. Now I\u2019m annoyed. 2 hours of driving, all while the price of bitcoin is dropping in value and I can\u2019t complete this damn thing. I get home and after waiting on hold  with their support team, they keep trying to give me alternative locations to pick up the cash. I politely tell them I\u2019ve had enough and I can\u2019t risk making more drives to empty machines. At this point I honestly think I\u2019m getting scammed. The support member mentions she can refund me, asks for my btc address, and I reply to a text with the info. After getting put on hold for another 5 mins she comes back saying she talked to her team and since the transaction is in \u201cthis status\u201d I\u2019m not entitled to a refund. Now I\u2019m really about to kiss my money goodbye. How am I not entitled to a refund if the original agreement wasn\u2019t satisfied? Should it be my responsibility to go drive another hour out of state to find a machine that MIGHT (emphasis on the might part) actually have my cash? I think I\u2019ve been more than patient enough at this point by driving to 3 locations, most would already be furious after the first one. I explain I really need this fixed somehow because I have no other options and to please help me. I get put on hold again for 20 mins then am told they processed the refund. I was nervous at first, and was told it might take 24 hours to receive. But at this point, I already considered the money gone so figured if a refund hits, GREAT. If not, I guess it\u2019s my fault for not being smarter. I\u2019m happy to report that this morning I DID receive my refund. When I woke up I almost decided to not leave a negative review, however, the absolutely ridiculous BS hoops I had to jump through to get my money back is not okay, and I hope someone sees this review and gives it thought before going through the same crap I did. 1 star for the fact I did get a refund, but 0 stars on every other aspect. DONT ALLOW YOUR MACHINES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS IF THEY CANT FULFILL THEM. I can\u2019t be the first or the last person this happens to. This company could have a lot of potential, the machines themselves look great, they\u2019re easy to navigate, they look smooth and modern and inviting, unlike the old ugly ATMs you see at the gas stations. But guess what? I\u2019ve used those old ugly btc ATMs that charge crappy fees, and they dispensed my cash within 5 seconds\u2026 I\u2019ll keep going there and not get sucked into another 5 hours of BS like this company did me.

Over just 10 days 3 transactions took a long time, not just hours but days. First transaction took 12 hours, 4 days later I made purchase on Friday and received it Tuesday and now once again made a purchase last night and 8 hours later still nothing. What really angers me is their site stating that most transactions take 15 mins but on RARE occasions, can take up to a hour. What is rare now a days is getting it under 8 hours. And I did my own little test and while waiting, I went to 2 other Bitcoin machines with other companies and had the Bitcoin in minutes. So how can other companies have it out in minutes and you guys take 4 days? And if you are going to be so slow, TELL PEOPLE, so we can go somewhere else. No notice on machine about any possible delays. Company obviously doesn't seem too concerned seeing how many other ppl are staying the same issues. When it takes longer than my bank, it defeats the whole purpose. Hopefully the company will get someone in charge who cares enough to figure out why they are only Bitcoin to have huge delays and fix the issue",

We have had a problem here and there with PNC over the years but enough is enough!! Today, I called the 1-800 customer service number. I needed a  document from our checking account. Some younger woman with a heavy foreign accent answered. She verified me and then I told her that I'd like to speak with a supervisor. She asked me why. I told her that I could not understand her. Back and forth I kept telling her this. She hung up on me. WOW!!! I, then, called the Bentleyville, PA branch. A woman named Sally answered my call. I told her what happened and, surprisingly, I was in the wrong. I proceeded with the call because I need this document.  She was very authoritative...she TOLD me what to do. She told me to text my husband at his work and told me what time for me to tell him to come in to get the document. She did not ASK she TOLD me. We do not have millions of dollars in PNC Bank but we do not have only pennies either. It does not matter. What happened to professionalism, common courtesy, and respect for customers (but also for people)??? ",

Joel Neitch who supposedly is the Branch Manager at 3202 E. BELL RD., PHOENIX, AZ 85032 completely screwed up an attempt to help me, the customer, resolve a Fraudulent Charge issue on my Debit Card Account there. Wasted close to 40 minutes of my time while he completely screwed up a phone call to three to five different corporate customer service departments at PNC. In short, I was promised by another supervisor there that it would be \"10 days at the most\" to get the Fraudulent charges credited back to my account. After Joel's interference now it's 90 days just to determine whether I get anything back. And temporarily he had an incorrect smaller amount approved and credited back to my account, then canceled it, now I have nothing. Thanks so much Joel for making this PNC customer and fraud victim have even more difficulty dealing with this. PNC IS NOT A BANK TO TRUST, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, INADEQUATE FRAUD PROTECTION, TOTAL DISRESPECT TOWARDS IT'S CUSTOMERS, MISLEADING AND FALSE INFORMATION EQUALS LIES IN MY OPINION.  I'm going to another bank ASAP, PNC is a joke and I hope they get bought out or collapse like some of these other banks that failed over the last couple years. ",

I did not ask about this, she brought it up and offered it to me and presented it as a guarantee while I was in the midst of applying for something else that would obviously be a hard credit check against me.

They do not know the business of banking and literally have no customer service at every level in this organization. Reported the issues to the top management and the response was the you can close the account. That is the level of service one can expect. Trying to leave the bank is another nightmare. Called two days ago to change auto debit instructions on a loan with the bank and spoke with 6 different people before someone promised to email a form to make the change.

And every month i pay my bill they put a different amount to my loan and a different amount to the intrest rate. Its never the same each month. They syated they charge and put more of your money towards the beginning of the loan. But its still only the same percentage rate. Whoch is a lie. Because if your charging more in the beginning then your taking more money then they should. Its a scam. Theres better companies out there they dont do this and they actually care about there customers.",

Today is February 18th and I still don't have the letter as lawyers are beating down my mother's door. I had to go into my investment portfolio to at SUNS lNVESTMENT to withdraw $53,000 that was used to pay some of her debts while still waiting for PNC.My mom was a loyal customer for decades and should never be treated this way. I can say with 100% confidence, that PNC IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST.",

I made a mistake and had my family bank make a. $2000 payment which was my monthly account balance. My family bank  payment the following day. My credit card was paid in full twice and reimbursed me immediately  My biggest mistake was depositing this check into my checking account. Someone inside the bank took it upon themself to stop payment and I am still fighting to get my money back. Immediately they began playing games making me create a legal paper trail with both banks to prove the bank's mistakes. This mistake went all the way to the President's office and stopped. Canceled due to the length of time. After I dropped my larger balance to a minimum amount. Even though I have never been late on any payments - 2 expensive cars. A $30,000 line of credit and $20,000 lines of credit on each credit card dropped my line of credit resulting in other cc to drop my lines of credit for no reason.

I had reported it as soon as I saw this on my PNC account. About 10 days after it happened. I was in the hospital when this happened. I just got their letters stating that they would be withdrawing the provisional credit because I filed it after the 2 month timeframe. I had filed it 10 days after it happened!! So I lost my money! Do NOT use this bank! They have uneducated people working there and if someone wants to rob you, you have NO chance of ever getting your money back!! I\u2019m closing my account tomorrow!!!",

    "comment_content": "PNC Bank doesn't know how to do accounting: For the first 88 payments of my home equity loan, PNC Bank applied my payments correctly. In 11/2023, in the PNC app, my payment was not applied to the principal nor was the interest noted. I called customer service on 11/27/23 who essentially blew me off. I tried another possible method to complain on the app which didn't work. On 11/28/23, the app asked me to rate my call to customer service: I took them up on that. I noted that my payment was finally updated on 11/28/23 after I filed my negative review of the customer service call. I received a phone call from a customer service rep responding to my negative review who said there would be an investigation. To date, I have received no feedback nor an explanation for the failure to properly apply my payment in a timely manner. There is something seriously wrong if a bank can't do accounting nor offer an explanation and apology. I will pay off my home equity loan shortly & never do business with PNC again.",

He called Tiffany in escalations and she basically said well its not our problem anymore. So they basically stole 700 dollars that i can guarentee he is not gonna get back. Sad excuse for a bank.

I set up the text alerts to alert me a week in advance for payment because I didn\u2019t have them set up on auto pay on three different occasions  I called the bank to explain to them I\u2019m not getting my alerts me and the agent would walk-through the steps that I had set up correctly and they would also check as well. Still their continue to be a problem with their online banking, The only thing I get is a payment is past due  alert and then when I go to make a payment they put all these charges on me causes my minimum payment was substantially increase because of the error from PNC My account balance was $593 and now is around 800. Of course I closed my account with this bank because I don\u2019t want to continue to be a victim of their corrupted system.

I received the closing statement and found $0.0 interest was paid on over $240k for 22 days in the back. They said the account was closed prior to the end of the month. Basically they cheated me of about $900 and the person I spoke to when closing the account didn't volunteer to tell me that.

    "comment_content": "Recently, my wife and I needed a substantial amount of cash to fund a home repair.  We decided to explore the home equity line of credit and chose to apply for one with PNC bank because their interest rates were better than similar offerings with other groups.  The PNC associates were friendly and helpful and the application process wasn't too hard...however our troubles began right after the application process was triggered.Not five minutes after finishing the application, the phone number we used on the form started getting telemarketer spam calls for similar lien/mortgage/line-of-credit products.It's been two weeks since then and we regularly receive 20 or more solicitation calls PER DAY.  The phone number is on the national do not call list, but it hasn't seemed to help.I even engaged in conversation with one of the solicitors and found out that it was a PNC affiliate (Transunion, used for the credit score check) from which they had received our information.During the application process there was a box we had to check saying that we agreed to share our information with PNC affiliates so that the proper background checks, home evaluations, and credit checks could be performed.   I don't know that the application could have been approved without us authorizing them to share the info.    However what has happened crosses a line and is to the level of harassment.  Would this have happened with any other bank we chose to work with?   Is there anything we could have done to prevent such things from happening in the future?In my mind, a critical metric for any bank should be how well they handle a person's private information and if they are taking steps to ensure that something like what we experienced should never happen.  PNC is a big bank, they could throw some weight to have prevented that.   I'm sure they're earning some kind of kickback in partnership revenue shares from Transunion being able to sell our information.   I can't accept that this level of exploitation of people in need of a loan should be (or should remain) the norm.",

I set up individual payments for the 3 subsequent months, because I cannot set up auto-pay in a state of being \"late.\" As of the first manually set up payment, they have not deducted the amount as scheduled, thus causing me to be \"late\" again. This is Third World Incompetent Banana Republic Stuff. Avoid this bank at all costs: their phone customer service are staffed by non-English speakers who layer on additional incompetence, leaving it up to the innocent \"customer\", me, to sort it all out.",

Not the main 800 number, mind you. There's a special number you have to call, and then you have to press \"0\" at the right time, even though that's not an option on the voicemail menu. The only option the automated system gives is to pay off the balance AND close the account, by sending a letter and payment to an address in Pittsburgh.

    "comment_content": "What went wrong? Everything! This bank is inept. My mortgage servicing was sold to this crap bank, and that is what my experience has been, crap. In a short six weeks I've had to contact them 10 times or more. Just getting an online login was a bloody mess with multiple missteps all on PNC's side. Their automated system is about has bad as it could possibly be. Good luck reaching a person let alone a native English speaking person who can at least better resolve the problem/s. To top it off they don't maintain a running balance...even on their monthly statements!!! You cannot determine by any ease if they are properly applying principal and interest payments. I have had to resort to my own spreadsheet tracking to confirm that they are accurate, which based on the statement and online details my first payment was applied differently to what was due per the statement. It was a minimal value difference but it shouldn't be off by even one cent. Have no idea how I will ever get it resolved nor any confidence that they will properly manage my mortgage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS ENTITY. They are misery personified. RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN!!!!!",

As a new small business owner my merchant account should have been kept at the local branch instead the small business rep and the PNC Clover rep set my account up as a business that would have 600,000 dollars in card transactions in a year\u2019s time. This made it so that the employees at the local branch were unable to help me as I began to have issues. Along the way there was a large reserve attached to my account ( which I was told once I met the amount I would get my money deposited into my account) I was lied to several times by both the rep and the PNC Clover rep. I purchased a Clover Flex through the bank thinking if I left PNC I could use with another bank only to find out from Clover that the Flex I purchased can only be used at PNC. Again this was never disclosed by the reps I worked with. Everyone at my local branch has been kind and helpful, the business rep and the PNC Clover rep tied up my money and disappeared after the paperwork was signed. I will be closing my merchant account and taking my business to another bank.",

    "comment_content": "On Saturday, 7 back-to-back fraudulent transactions were posted in my account. I contacted Customer Service, and they said the transactions looked fraudulent, and I confirmed that they were. I was told they caught things in time and they would not process them. They also suggested that I change debit cards to make sure it didn't happen again. On Tuesday (after New Year's Day on Monday), I went to the branch in the morning and changed cards. Later in the day, I looked and saw that the transactions had gone through; they hadn't been stopped by PNC Customer Support as they had said they would be. They asked if I wanted to file a dispute of the charges, which means the money taken out would not be available until 10 business days, and then just provisionally. The dispute could go on for another 3 months, and the money would just be provisionally mine until it is resolved. That's unacceptable. PNC failed to decline the transactions when they were posted, as they said they would. Maybe due to their outdated IT systems, probably old IBM mainframe computers with a screen-scraper interface to make it look like a modern GUI interface. I suspect their technology is outdated. The bottom line is, even if you report a charge as fraudulent right away like I did, PNC does not take responsibility for what happens. Your money is not safe in a PNC account! I am in the process of moving my money to Chase where I have another checking account. PNC's Customer Service has always been lacking, and this is my final exposure to their outmoded way of doing things. Be cautious!",

I've sent every piece of documentation that they've asked for, time and time and time again. I've visited two branches and I've talked to 4 bankers in person. I've sent the information by mail, email, and fax and every time I call to follow up, the information is somehow missing. This last time, the woman said that the information \"just arrived at her desk\" and they would have everything squared away in 10-14 days. That was 21 days ago.  I just followed up AGAIN and now the information is again GONE. Now I'm going to have to hire an attorney to get my DEAD father's IRA's where he wanted them, with me. It's been 6 months and I haven't been able to pay his funeral expenses!! If PNC was the last bank on the planet, I'd hide my money under my bed.",

Their effort/ budget spent on satisfying their customers and keeping up ATM equipment horrific  This Regional bank office in downtown Manistee refuses to notifying ATM customers that their on site ATM machine is broken and will not dispense cash.  Cash withdrawal from a bank owned atm is an, account holder expectation, and primary ,  function of an ATM  machine When brought to their attention the response is \u201c there are other third party machines to get cash from    So, they let their customers input card, put in code , and try to figure out withdrawal options which are not available on the screen. Showing zero considers for customer time and effort to try snd use the machine for withdrawal and realize the machine can\u2019t complete the transaction. When confronted.. Bank employees refuse to put sign on machine saying it can\u2019t provide cash and waiting on corporate to repair. Sorry.. how inconsiderate to customers !!",

I've been with the same financial institution for over 25 yrs., my bank was recently acquired by PNC (previously Compass/BBVA, and prior to that, Founders Bank). I must say the customer service has fallen way below average and no comparison whatsoever to the excellent customer service rendered by Founders and BBVA. Unfortunately the personnel (PNC) are not trained to interact with the public in a professional manner, there's a language barrier and my number one complaint is; they (CS reps) do not listen to customer's concern and/or issues, and they talk over you, very frustrating.",

    "comment_content": "PNC repossessed my boat and sold it at auction after failing to update my address in their system! My payments were on autopay and were going to the prior bank (my loan was sold twice). Even after proving I had requested an address change three times and a PNC employee was found to alter an official notice of repossession (updating my address), because one payment in 3 years was late over 30 days, the law states they have a right to repossess a boat (luxury item). I had moved and hadn\u2019t lived at that address for almost two years!Regardless, they hired a team of attorneys and I lost the lawsuit. To make matters worse, this was 4 years ago and because I refused to pay the amount due plus attorney fees, they continue to hit my credit every month stating the loan is pending repossession. I\u2019ve never missed a payment on a loan. The only reason one payment was late was due to the first mortgagee change and the customer service rep told me to wait to make my next payment until the new account was set up. This is the ONLY negative mark against my credit and my score went from the low 800\u2019s to under 700 over night. I have a rare blood disease and they dragged out this lawsuit probably hoping I would die. Well guess what? I\u2019m still here and I\u2019m pissed. If they are going to continue to ding my credit every month, I am going to let the world know. Really? Come on folks!",

Didn\u2019t get it so I contacted them again. I also told them to close the account instead because I was going to use chase bank instead, it\u2019s a bit closer. They have now sent me another statement but now instead of zero they have started trying to charge me a monthly service fee when I told them on twitter to close the account instead. Twitter is a scam and do is chase bank as well apparently, all they do is steal money and guck the economy up to spread communism or capitalism or socialism.I also got locked out a personal student checking account I tried to open there and never was able to deposit money, Pittsburgh is no good apparently. I was just planning to use them as a creditor for a credit card but you have to have a checking account there to apply for one.",

I called to close a corporate credit card due fraudulent transactions and suspicious activity on 12//7/23, which took 2 separate calls to complete, over 2 hours! I requested the card be closed and new card be Fed Ex overnighted to my office as I would be leaving on 12/10/23 for business. On 12/8/23, I called PNC back for status as the replacement had not arrived, I was told informed my request had been entered on 12/8/23, the card had not been mailed. You can of  course guess my frustration and the anger, particularly when the customer service told me to place the business expenses for a week worth of travel on my personal credit card (no one in their right mind does that!). I was transferred to several people, eventually back to the Fraud Dept. I was assured a Supervisor would contact me within 24 hours. Nope. On Monday, 12/11/23  I called PNC for status, only to be informed the card had still not printed as I had called on 12/8/23. I spoke with another supervisor and demanded they review the recorded statements and I would provide screens shots of phone logs along with a coworker who was in the office, who could verify the length of time I was on hold both times on 12/7/23 resolving the issues. I was told there was no need, PNC is not lying or \"manipulating\" records. So, it is Monday, 12/11/23 at 5:30pm EST, there is still no tracking number and I was told a supervisor will call me tomorrow to follow-up. I have absolutely no faith this will occur.  More likely I will have to do their job for them. Long story short, here is their system, if you need a replacement card call M-TH before 3pm EST and demand a replacement Fed Ex, get everyone's name,  if the request is made on Friday, they do not process it until Monday.",

Within in minutes I recognized the scam and went into PNC to report it. They could give me zero information because I am not \"officially\" their customer, despite my money being deposited into a scam account there. I made a police report but PNC at no point would give me any information about the fraud event and barely cooperated with the police. My money is likely long gone, so the police didn't want to invest very much time either. The branch referred to their \"fraud department\" but the fraud department was completely unreachable. I found email contacts the police had for PNC but was always told \"someone was working on it\" and that was all. The fact that PNC NEVER worked with me to let me know the outcome of their internal investigation is really poor service for this situation. I have no idea if they ever had intention of actually helping this investigation. It felt like they were just protecting themselves and gave no care to the fact that I lost so much money through a scam using their bank. I would never recommend this bank to anyone given this experience.  Very poor communication, barriers at every turn, and no path for better customer service in this situation. I may not have been a customer at the time of the fraud, but their bank was used to steal my money. They made it easy for the fraud event to happen, and had no avenue in place to help someone in their community who was wronged using their institution. This event has insured I will never be their customer.",

The PNC receipt dated 8/28/2023 had an exchange rate of 1.1571 which returned 2,590.00 in Euros. For 2,996.89 American  dollars.When returning from Europe I check the exchange rate on 8/28/2023 an found that it was .9260 and not 1.1571 as PNC stated. The .9260 would have given me 2,775.00 in Euros. A difference of 180 euros in my favor.I went to my local branch with this issue and they called the PNC exchange department and put them on speaker phone. The PNC representative said that PNC used other exchange rates. Really, how many exchange rates are there? I thought exchange rates are a world standard. If you are a customer of PNC I strongly suggest to proceed with both eyes open. They have sneaky ways of screwing there customers. I will be drawing my three checking acts to zero and moving on.",

BBVA would have and did when I was a victim of fraud with them. So I can PNC and was quickly told there is nothing I can do until it moves from pending to posted. I\u2019m trying to avoid it posting because they weren\u2019t my charges. So I took it upon myself to call these retailers and two out of the 3 of them took the charges off. So 5 out of the 6 charges gone! Great! However, this last one has been pending for a week and still can\u2019t do anything. Oh and on top of that they charged me $7.50 for a card replacement as if I lost my card! So much for valuing their customers. This is pretty typical of big corporations and it\u2019s really sad.

    "comment_content": "Do not use pnc bank or atm for ANYTHING. I was a customer with pnc bank and they never was helpful with anything. When my card expired they did not send me a new card AND when I used one of their atms (not with a pnc card) their atm took $300 from me. I spoke with 4 supervisor (after being hung up on multiple times) and the last one told me that the same thing happened to her and that their atm\u2019s do an audit and my funds will automatically go back into my card because the atm will see that it was an error on their end. Every experience with a pnc customer service agent or supervisor has been the worse. They do not care about their customers, anyone who answers their line is rude, not empathetic, and they will \u201cplace you on hold\u201d and then hang up on you. I worked at a call center so I know how easy it to press the end button. I filed a complaint on 8/25/23, they told me someone will call me in 24/28 business hours. My $300 never came on Tuesday. I ended up having to file a dispute with my bank (we all know how long dispute takes) so that was a $300 lose and since I\u2019m not a ATM customer they do not care but if that\u2019s the case only pnc card holders should be able to use their bank, right????? No one called me in 48 business hours for the complaints so complaints mean nothing. STAY FAR AWAY FROM ATMS AND GETTING A CARD WITH THEM IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY. Poor customer service.",

    "comment_content": "Can you give ZERO *'s?  Because that's what this bank, P-N-C, deserves.I have banked with them for over 7 years.  Started out great.  Direct deposit, no fees, as promised.Since that time, the company I was with sold due to Covid, and I was out of a job.  So, no money coming in...and thus, no direct deposit.  AND THUS...$15 per month I was and am still being charged for the privilege of allowing P-N-C to use MY money for THEIR interests (loans, raises for their executives, etc.)I have been back to work for a while now and of course I set up direct deposit with this bank that I assumed was fair and had their customers' best interest in mind.  Well, today I found out that I couldn't be more wrong.They have been charging this fee EVER SINCE I lost the previous job, and now they say the \"type\" of account I have does not permit fees to be waived.  The TYPE of account is responsible, and not the greedy humans setting the account policies!  The audacity!So, I guess, no, I know, that this is the end of my \"relationship\" with this financial institution which is now being run more like Bank Of America these days...that's not a compliment.  B-of-A has long been the model of how NOT to do banking, and PNC is following down that same shady path.If you are reading this and share in this experience as a PNC customer, or if you are considering which bank to LEND your money to, there are WAY BETTER banks out there.M&T Bank does not charge a fee, regardless of direct deposit; neither does CNB Bank, and I'm sure there are others.PNC flat out sucks, in this person's opinion.",

    "comment_content": "I have been using many different credit cards for several decades. I pay my CC statements off in full and on time every month. The exceptions are when CC statements get lost in the mail and I don't catch it, which I almost always do because I keep a bill paying chart. I paid PNC credit card statement balance in full by phone on the due date with the automated system and it said my payment was accepted and on time. They still charged a late fee and refused to wave it. Mind you I have been a PNC bank customer for decades and had my PNC CC for over 6 years making payments on time and in full as described above. When an oops happens with any other CC they are happy to wave the fee because \"I am a valued customer\". But not PNC. They said the due date was 6pm on the due date for automated system phone payments (something no other credit card does), but midnight for online payments. I made my payment at 7pm with the automated system, which told me my payment was processed and on time. But even the mangers at PNC CC services refused to wave the late fee for a payment made on time. They clearly don't value their good customers. Expect lots of empty lip service about how they value your business but actions indicating they really don't. Needless to say I cancelled my PNC credit card after the conversation with managers today, and will take all my money out of PNC bank once I have made other arrangements. The bank has been pulling all its benefits, and adding lots of fees. I haven't had to pay any fees yet but they aren't paying me enough for my money in their bank and it is clear management there no longer values its customers either. No other CC that I have ever had treated its customers with such disrespect.",

    "comment_content": "The one an only teller was friendly and personable to a degree and that's the only reason for the one star. When you are a customer and want to talk with an actual banker no one is ever available. Should have realized when I had to make an appointment 5 days in advance to open an account that this bank was severely understaffed. I've had an car loan there for years and normally pay by check with no problem. On one occasion I didn't have a check with so I went inside to pay with a debit card at which point I had show proof of identification because I didn't have an account with them. That was after standing in line for 30 minutes. Stupidly I opened a checking account with them. I sold a piece of property for $100,000 I went with the check at 1:00 on Friday afternoon and was told the banker was out for lunch and to return later that afternoon. I did return that afternoon and waited awhile before being told come back Monday. The teller said she was having \u201cissues\u201d. All I needed was 5 minutes of her time to advise me. Promptly went to another bank that wasn't having \u201cissues\u201d and opened an account. Somethings you don't want to talk to a teller about especially when she is the only one and dividing her time between the drive-thru as well as working the counter. I fully realize that my $100 Grand is nothing to a bank worth billions but it's important to me. It's probably not her fault or the staff's fault but the lack of any help. Sorry I ever went to PNC. Planning to draw this account down and let this account slowly evaporate as I see from these reviews that it is almost impossible to close an account with PNC. I've lost the cost of the checks anyway! Thanks for the lesson PNC! I'll do more homework in the future!",

    "comment_content": "Before I start unloading, I must say that one positive aspect of banking with PNC has been um, well uhh... Hmm, I guess nothing!Seriously though, please think long and hard about banking with PNC before opening an account. And if you then decide it's a good idea, think long and hard about it some more.Ok look. For starters, the PNC mobile banking app is terrible. Repeat after me: Ter-ri-ble!!!  It is unexpectedly 'down for maintenance' more than any app I've ever used. I'm sure others will agree. Yep, little to no warning. Just, randomly you will go to make a transaction and upon opening the app - 'Sorry! Closed for maintenance!' Especially at night! So if you are a night owl, beware!The other thing I want to make clear is how undeniably shady they are with how they handle and process your money. Transactions can -and will- be in 'pending' status for days, even weeks! During which time you will make other transactions under the assumption that your available balance is current and reflective of all prior transactions - pending or otherwise. But Noooooo! All of a sudden you will see those pending transactions process and you are left scratching your head looking at a negative account balance that they will happily gift you an additional overdraft fee for.You might be thinking 'Well I can just keep track of my balance with a pencil and a bank log like they did in 1929'. Welllll, kinda. And if you like pencils. And log books. Alot. So here's what's shady....I would transfer money to my CashApp account for example, for gas, to avoid a hold at the pump. My PNC mobile app would then deduct the money from my balance upon transferring it to CashApp, but the transaction would then be in 'pending' status. Sometimes. But not others. And sometimes it may not be finalized for days. I've contacted PNC who, of course deflected responsibility and shifted the blame, citing the excuse that \"it depends on how long it takes their system to communicate with our system.\" Good one! Oh, and good luck getting your numbers to match theirs after the dust settles from this days-old transaction. It's so frustrating and confusing and frustrating again that you end up giving up and taking their word that everything perfectly worked out just exactly as it should have no worries needed!  ...Right!I'm thinking like 'well d*mn, what do they mean how long it takes their systems to communicate? Isn't that the whole point of digital online banking? It should be, instantaneous. I mean, we're not hauling the wagons across the frontier anymore folks, what are you actually doing with my money that takes six days digitally to finalize through a computer!? Huh?????So yeah, review over Rant over. I'm done. I'm out. Hope you never get involved with this \"institution.\" Good luck!",
