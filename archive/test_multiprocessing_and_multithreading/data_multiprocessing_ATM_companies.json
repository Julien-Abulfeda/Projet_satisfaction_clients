The Payment HQ is the best merchant services and most trustworthy company I have dealt with. They support my industry which is considered high risk and made it very easy to get me an account approved. Besides getting an account approved and processing without issue, they also had a large catalog of terminal and point of sale solutions to select from. The point-of-sale system Cesar recommended to invest in has helped save me countless hours of inventory management. You get great customer service and options to select what\u2019s best for your business. I absolutely enjoy working with The Payment HQ and of course their best rep Cesario.

They continue to send me e-notices even though I have told them multiple times I can't login (probably telling me about all the fees that they are charging me rather than giving my money back as requested).  I suspect I am going to have to get a lawyer involved to get my money back from them.Bottom line:  I would bury my money in glass jars in the backyard before I would use Meriwest again.

It's been a few years since I last used them, I logged into my account today made a deposit and now I'm not able to withdraw any Bitcoin. Every time I try to send it out it just says failed, try again.  It's infuriating, there's so many other ways I could buy Bitcoin but this one was convenient at the time and now my money is just stuck. It's a shame because years ago I never had any issues like this.To top it off I can't get a hold of anybody, I can fill out a ticket which simply just sends a email saying they received it, the phone number does not work and there is no live chat. I have a feeling this is going to take a long time to get my money back.  So frustrating!!",

Numerous calls to customer service leads to people who are only allowed to give the customer service email, service representatives say they literally have no information beyond an email address. Numerous emails I\u2019ve sent each day are returned with \u201cemail received\u201d. There are no humans to speak with except for the customer service reps who say the company is unable to process my request to buy Bitcoin because there is a shortage of Bitcoin at the company level and that it will be resolved today. This started 6 days ago!!! I want my cash back if Crypto Dispensers is unable to allow me to purchase Bitcoin! Do not get involved with this company, they can\u2019t even perform the purchase and then they keep your money!!!! Stay away!!!Update: 9th day of not being able to buy Bitcoin or get my money back. Nobody from customer service or Helpdesk will help me. Absolutely atrociousUpdate: I was finally able to purchase Bitcoin and am appreciating that I can put this situation behind me.",

I must say this was the smoothest Bitcoin purchase by far with no hassles and no holdups. You choose deposit cash to account, they send you an email with a scannable barcode. Take that to the cashier and load anywhere from. $20-$500 as well as a $4.95 processing fee. The money was instantly on my account but took 15 min to clear. Then I purchased my Bitcoin and it sent to my wallet immediately and my wallet verified the deposit and is waiting for the blockchain to finalize it. Super simple and duper easy. The only bad thing I must say is $12 fee for a $120 purchase was a little steep but overall very easy and i will use this method from now on. Today is 3-11-21 and this is a real and truthful statement. My names Ryan from Palm Springs.",

So, I was never able to do the transaction.  It happened at both CVS and Rite Aid.  So I went and got a new account with another company and was able to buy the bite coins I needed to send.

        "comment_content": "Looking for the closest Bitcoin ATM I found several ads on Google for this company when I saw that they were tied to several major retailers. And so I thought this would be a safe bet I loaded the minimum amount which I'm glad they did offer a additional compensation for signing up and adding money which double the deposit.  But that's useless, because when you go to purchase the Bitcoin with your loaded funds, it fails, I've tried multiple addresses all tied to my social security number all verified, all normal coin base bitpay etc. And guess what? After filing a support ticket? I get a message back saying oh sorry, we're having a little issue with our bank. But don't worry your money safe. Why don't you go ahead and just wire us $2500? And we'll load that right away because you know you guys could manage $20. So why not just start a 2500? Are you absolutely f****** crazy?  This is not a good look, it's not that hard to put up a message that says Hey, this is what's going on. We're having an issue or working to resolve it instead, you trap people's money, which I'm sure the refund process isn't nearly as simple as giving you the money and I wonder where the money sits. Are there interests being made? Are you making money on my money? When you dishonestly and deceitfully took it? I think you probably are because you know that's what people do you sit on money? You make money.  So I call the customer service number and I get a nice receptionist who can't do s*** except give me a voicemail and so I am going to hope hit every review and then start finding complaints with regulatory agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau, the department of financial institutions, my State and the State that this business. Is licensed in respectively is Attorney General? The Better Business Bureau and anywhere else. I could possibly fit it in.  Cause this is not okay.I am a thorn and you're gonna feel it",

We take all customer concerns seriously and strive to provide a positive experience for all our users.Firstly, we want to clarify that we had a temporary issue that coincided with your first experience as a new user. Due to high demand and a system update, we temporarily ran out of available Bitcoins. This was not a deliberate attempt to inconvenience you, and we apologize for any misunderstanding. We are continuously working to improve our system and ensure a smoother experience for our users.The option to wire additional funds was offered to you as a means to facilitate your purchase separately from our CDReload service. We understand that it may have come across differently, and we're sorry if it caused any confusion. Our intention was to provide you with every available option to meet your needs.It's worth noting that even established services like Coinbase and Bitpay encounter occasional issues due to the complex nature of the cryptocurrency space. Human error can occur, and we appreciate your patience while we resolved the situation promptly.We would like to emphasize that your satisfaction is essential to us. We provided you with a bonus as a new user and resolved the issue within a reasonable timeframe. Furthermore, we offer customer support through various channels, including a dedicated phone line, to assist our users.Our service, CDReload, is designed to offer competitive rates and convenience, enabling users to add cash to their accounts at major retailers like CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, Casey's General Stores, and others. We aim to provide a secure and accessible platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts.While we regret the negative experience you had, we hope you can understand that our goal is to make cryptocurrency more accessible and secure for everyone. We encourage you to reconsider your review in light of the steps we've taken to address your concerns and improve our service.Thank you for your feedback, and we hope to have the opportunity to serve you better in the future.Sincerely,The Crypto Dispensers Team ",

They explained to me about some issues they had been having with changes that they were having to make due to the recent economic upheavals and that they were trying to get everything taken care of and get my bitcoin sent out. I was encouraged to believe that I should have my bitcoin by the end of this past week. The call was helpful and amiable on both sides. At the end of the call I requested an email to be sent detailing all that had been discussed so that I would have it in writing. I was assured that I would receive an email that day and they requested my email address. As soon as the call was ended, I immediately sent my email address along with a nice note reminding them to please send me the statement of what had been discussed. A couple of hours later I received a text, assuring me once again that I would get an email that day. On Friday, after not having yet received the email, nor the bitcoin, I went back to the mall where I Initially deposited my money in the crypto dispensers ATM  and I spoke with the specialty leasing manager. She placed a call to crypto dispensers and was not able to reach anyone, but was forced to leave a message, which is what happens every time you call. She stated that they needed to get back with her for the issue to be solved that day. She also sent an email  stating the same thing. Today is the close of Saturday and I have not received the email, nor have I yet received my bitcoin. There has been no response whatsoever to any of our requests for communication.",

Instead it is someone else's wallet address and they have taken my deposit and handed it out to a dozen other addresses. I have threatened to sue them and I still don't hear anything from them.

Everywhere online says they fired 50% of there staff and are going out of business soon. They clearly don't have the funds to pay people there money and it is clear they are going bankrupt soon. Do not use their atm.Friday 10/28/22 still nothing and when I called customer service they stated there is nothing they can do and if I wanted to file a complaint then I could do that on their website. This company needs to be investigated and then prosecuted.If you think writing a reply and talking about how your business can't handle the transactions from your customer because you just cut a bunch of your staff member then you probably should consider closing your doors so you don't have to make excuses for the way you treat your customers.",

I emailed coin cloud but received no response and then today, I wasn\u2019t thinking and used their atm again.  It was only 100 bucks but again, I have received no message regarding my transaction so I have no clue if or when it will show up in my wallet. No notice on the screen of delayed times or anything.

I sent 40.00 in Bitcoin to an address and here we are 12:27a.m. the next day and still I have not received my Bitcoin. My Girlfriend also sent 40.00 right after me and she still haven't received her Bitcoin either. This is beyond ridiculous. How are they still in business? I called customer service and was told I should receive my Bitcoin later today sometime, no particular time frame or anything just later today sometime. This seems like straight robbery to me. How do you pay the highest rates for the slowest service that is so backwards to me. If you need your Bitcoin sent at a reasonable time like that day in particular, I don't recommend using coin cloud unless you have a couple days to spare and your not worried about time and don't mind spending extra money to wait.",

Would not send me a code via text or call to my phone after I entered my number.3. The image on screen was rotated 90 degrees and was unusable.4. The screen was showing a Windows desktop instead of the start screen.This is ridiculous for the high, 20% fee I must pay to use these machines.As for calling in advance, there's at least a 30 minute hold every time I tried to call.I wish I had an alternative at this point.",

Completely off the wall.It's no wonder store owners around here are taking out there ATMs and putting in their competitors.I feel like an idiot that I just didn't go online and use an online exchange and pay a five or seven percent premium as opposed to what's turning out to be a 50% premium (assuming I actually ever get my freaking coins)I call in to see where my coins are in the ladies literally said to me what is bitcoin cash?Like what are you talking about I gave you a Bitcoin cash address and I chose altcoins and your receipt even says you're sending me Bitcoin cash.She says to me oh I didn't know our wallet is Bitcoin so we have to go buy them and send them to you so it could take a few hours.I would highly recommend you avoid using this company.",

        "comment_content": "Coincloud use to be the \"only\" bitcoin atm machine in my area. Now there's several different brands. Some have lower fees some have higher. As \"most\" people are aware, processing times are \"mostly\" determined by the blockchain. Within the last 18mos or longer regardless of either atm my funds are \"normally\" confirmed within 30mins or less. Earlier today I purchased using Coincloud atm, I recieved a txt saying it \"will\" be confirmed in appr. 47mins. It is going on 9hrs and still no confirmation. I have spoken with Customer Service twice since.The 1st thing they will tell you \"regardless\" of your reason to call is:1. It can take up to 24hrs2. It depends on hw busy the blockchain is which is true to a certain degree.What they \"wont\" tell u is 1. Coincloud Atm machines have not been operating smoothly within the last year or so. 2. Your wait time is \"NOT\" because of the \"normal\" processing times but because of a technical glitch in there systems. Who buys bitcoin expecting it not to be processed til the nxt day? They are trained to tell you a bunch of bs that doesn't make sense. Try asking to speak to a manager or supervisor and see how far that takes you. THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK TO ANYONE IN UPPER MANAGEMENT. Which moreso pisses me off. This isnt my 1st time having UNUSUALLY LONG PROCESSING TIMES ALONG WITH HIGHER THAN NORMAL FEES but I can assure you Mr. Coincloud, it'll be my last. For those looking for LOWER fees and FAST confirmations w/o having to use a dam code try Googling COINFLIP ATMS in your area, they're in \"most\" 7/11 convenience stores and most Pittstop gas stations.Coincloud has proven to me once again that my business isn't valued. I'd rather pay a higher fee and wait 48hrs versus using a dam code because there fees are 2dam high and not owning up that their machines are not working properly. Ez fix, ADMIT your errors and do WHATEVER you need to do to keep from losing a customer. (I will be copy pasting this post everywhere I can).Thanks for reading.*AND AS FOR YOUR REPLY WISHING ME THE BEST OF LUCK, IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LUCK WITH YOUR UNEDUCATED CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS AND RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FEES THAT YOU BLAME ON MINERS, NOT TO MENTION THE 10HOUR PROCESSING TIMES THAT YOU BLAME ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. THIS POST IS ONLY INTENDED TO MAKE PEOPLE FULLY AWARE WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT USING YOUR WALLET OR YOUR ATM. * My apologies if it seems as if you've read this post before, you probably have, I'm doing my best to repost this everywhere including ALL social media platforms.

        "comment_content": "Absolutely awful experience. And I\u2019ve not once taken the time to write a negative review for any company or service because I\u2019m pretty lenient, and like to think of everyone as human and capable of mistakes. But this place needs to get their s**t together. Seems like most reviews show they\u2019ve had bad experiences buying bitcoin, well I\u2019ve had a pretty bad one trying to sell mine for cash. After searching online for hours which ATM allows you to SELL bitcoin, I came across these guys. Went to a kiosk, and tried to sell $1000 worth of bitcoin. Everything looked good, it gave me a QR code to send the BTC to, and after I sent it I received a link to my phone to track the status. Went and sat in my car for about 30 mins til the BTC transaction was fully confirmed, then got a text saying the cash was ready for pickup and to go back to the kiosk. Went back, and was told by the kiosk screen they can\u2019t complete the transaction because the kiosk doesn\u2019t have the cash available. OH COOL, so there isn\u2019t a system in place to prevent me from starting a transaction that they can\u2019t fulfill? Weird. Anyways\u2026. The kiosk then gives me a drop down menu of other kiosks in the area that have the available cash, so it \u201ctransfers\u201d the transaction to the other kiosk I choose. Found one that was 20 minutes away\u2026 so I chose that one. I drive there, excited to finally finish this mess. Guess what? Same error! You\u2019ve got to be sh*tting me. No cash in the machine. It gives me the same prompt \u201cplease select another location\u201d. Unfortunately now the nearest location is further away, about 35 minutes backwards from where I live\u2026 so I call their support team and explain the issue. I said \u201clisten, I only want to drive to this other location if you can absolutely guarantee me that this kiosk actually has the funds to give me\u201d. They assured me it did and that it\u2019s rare for a machine to not have the available cash. Funny cause it already happened twice. Before I leave, silly me decides to try another transaction for $500, hopeful that maybe the machine was maybe short in cash but had enough to do $500. I sent the btc and get the same error even after it does tell me it has enough cash to complete the $500. Now I\u2019ve got $1500 missing and need to recover. Anyways, I take the drive, finally get there, and I get another similar BS error. Tried twice just to make sure it wasn\u2019t an error with my phone. Nope, sure enough their system is just really whack and yet again it doesn\u2019t have the cash. Now I\u2019m annoyed. 2 hours of driving, all while the price of bitcoin is dropping in value and I can\u2019t complete this damn thing. I get home and after waiting on hold  with their support team, they keep trying to give me alternative locations to pick up the cash. I politely tell them I\u2019ve had enough and I can\u2019t risk making more drives to empty machines. At this point I honestly think I\u2019m getting scammed. The support member mentions she can refund me, asks for my btc address, and I reply to a text with the info. After getting put on hold for another 5 mins she comes back saying she talked to her team and since the transaction is in \u201cthis status\u201d I\u2019m not entitled to a refund. Now I\u2019m really about to kiss my money goodbye. How am I not entitled to a refund if the original agreement wasn\u2019t satisfied? Should it be my responsibility to go drive another hour out of state to find a machine that MIGHT (emphasis on the might part) actually have my cash? I think I\u2019ve been more than patient enough at this point by driving to 3 locations, most would already be furious after the first one. I explain I really need this fixed somehow because I have no other options and to please help me. I get put on hold again for 20 mins then am told they processed the refund. I was nervous at first, and was told it might take 24 hours to receive. But at this point, I already considered the money gone so figured if a refund hits, GREAT. If not, I guess it\u2019s my fault for not being smarter. I\u2019m happy to report that this morning I DID receive my refund. When I woke up I almost decided to not leave a negative review, however, the absolutely ridiculous BS hoops I had to jump through to get my money back is not okay, and I hope someone sees this review and gives it thought before going through the same crap I did. 1 star for the fact I did get a refund, but 0 stars on every other aspect. DONT ALLOW YOUR MACHINES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS IF THEY CANT FULFILL THEM. I can\u2019t be the first or the last person this happens to. This company could have a lot of potential, the machines themselves look great, they\u2019re easy to navigate, they look smooth and modern and inviting, unlike the old ugly ATMs you see at the gas stations. But guess what? I\u2019ve used those old ugly btc ATMs that charge crappy fees, and they dispensed my cash within 5 seconds\u2026 I\u2019ll keep going there and not get sucked into another 5 hours of BS like this company did me.

Over just 10 days 3 transactions took a long time, not just hours but days. First transaction took 12 hours, 4 days later I made purchase on Friday and received it Tuesday and now once again made a purchase last night and 8 hours later still nothing. What really angers me is their site stating that most transactions take 15 mins but on RARE occasions, can take up to a hour. What is rare now a days is getting it under 8 hours. And I did my own little test and while waiting, I went to 2 other Bitcoin machines with other companies and had the Bitcoin in minutes. So how can other companies have it out in minutes and you guys take 4 days? And if you are going to be so slow, TELL PEOPLE, so we can go somewhere else. No notice on machine about any possible delays. Company obviously doesn't seem too concerned seeing how many other ppl are staying the same issues. When it takes longer than my bank, it defeats the whole purpose. Hopefully the company will get someone in charge who cares enough to figure out why they are only Bitcoin to have huge delays and fix the issue",

I\u2019d love to clarify the current process for in-app check deposit hold times.Once the deposit is made, it will then be reviewed within 1 business day. Once accepted, the deposit is made available in 2-5 business days. Factors that affect the speed with which your funds become available may include: the length and extent of your relationship with NorthOne, amount of historical transaction information, having a history of returned checks, and more. Please refer to NorthOne\u2019s Deposit Account Agreement, specifically section E.11, for more details on check deposit availability.I noticed that your deposit was initiated on 1/13, and the check will be available after the standard 5-business-day hold. It's worth noting that 1/15 was a Banking Holiday for MLK Day, which is treated as a non-business day. Since no money movement occurs on banking holidays, it might give the impression that the check is being held for an additional business day.Should you have any additional questions regarding your mobile check deposit, our Support Team is happy to clarify when a pending check will be made available in your Account.NorthOne Customer Care",

        "comment_content": "I have been in business for almost 30 years, and when I decided to try an online bank which would connect with more of the modern day apps, I found NorthOne. Banking with them was a horrible mistake and I want to warn other businesses about putting your money with them.1. The first incident happened when they flagged my account for an unknown $1 payment from a Paypal account. They froze my account, which meant no money could come in or out. I was on vacation and it took me days to realize what happened. And it took weeks to get it fixed, because once the bank account was frozen, that sent a chain reaction to our merchant processing, vendors, etc... and the clean up and docs required to get everything going again, was insane.Again, all that happend, was we received $1 from a PayPal account, which was probably verifying our bank account and something we had set in motion. Something that any reasonable bank would have called us, sent a text and email, asking if we knew about the transaction. But not NorthOne, they just shut us down. This was the first incident.2. The next incident almost a year later, was when I noticed a $48 dollar Burger King charge on a virtual card we had never used. As the owner of a gym, that charge stood out becuase we don't eat there. I notified NorthOne, I verified that it was not us, they verified the virtual card had never been used before, and then they closed our bank account down. They didn't cancel that card, they just closed our account. Which meant we needed a new bank account yesterday, and every vendor, every utility and every payment on auto pay, which is everyone, was suddenly not being paid. If you have ever lost a card you know what a hassle it is to contact and update your new information to everyone. It takes days and hours upon hours of time. Which is why I didn't cancel this bank the first time. Because it is so time consuming to have to start anew.If you are considering this bank, don't. Eventually you will be sorry.",

As soon as there is an update on your dispute, you will be notified via email to your email on file.For additional context, when certain unauthorized transaction(s) occur on your Account, your Account is locked for your security. A review is then completed to make sure that there is no compromised information within your Account. This review was communicated on October 23rd, shortly before your Account was locked. When it was deemed that the Account would need to be closed due to compromised information, this was also communicated via email on October 24th once the review was completed. While the current dispute is still ongoing, you're able to re-apply for a new Account at any time by going to join.northone.com. Thank you for your understanding here.

Yes, at the moment, instant transfers are not supported using your NorthOne Mastercard\u00ae Debit Card. We are looking into methods of supporting this in the future, but in the meantime, we encourage customers to not send instant transfers through CashApp.Instead, when going through the flow in CashApp, the application will allow you to set up an instant transfer to your NorthOne card, however the funds will take the same amount of time as a standard transfer 1-3 business days and CashApp will still charge the instant fee.Because of this, we suggest linking your bank account instead of your card going forward, and only using the free standard transfer method to avoid incurring fees.As for loading cash on your card, NorthOne doesn\u2019t charge any fees for cash loads. The additional ATM fees you may experience are charged by 3rd party ATMs or ATM owners.We do apologize if your NorthOne experience so far is not what you had hoped for, but we are very open to your feedback and appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review. If there\u2019s anything else we can do for you or help you with, please let us know through our in-app chat or by emailing support@northone.com. We\u2019re happy to help.

Two change that would really help: (1) I'd like for the Deposit Account to show an account balance column on the right as all banks have this; (2) I'd like to see the account history for Deposit Account and folders in a page-by-page view instead of continuous scroll. Sometimes it takes a long time to scroll to where I need to get. Yes, I know there is a Filter option. However, all banks I know of give a paging option. E.g., options to: (a) view x number of transactions per page; (b) at bottom of page provide page number links 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. THANK YOU!!! :)",

        "comment_content": "Their incompetence to approve mobile check deposits as it is incredible that a bank like this would take 7 business days to clear funds on a cashiers check from a reputable bank.01/09/24I did deposit a Cashiers Check from a reputable bank on 01/04/24, same day was advise via email the check was being processed. Next day was advised that check was approved and that was going to take 48 hours to be cleared, those 48 hours passed and contacted customer service via chat Monday 01/08/24 bank does not a physical office nor a customer service dept, direct phone number where you can call when you need to. Representative on the chat platform inform me the following:\"Check are in review for 48 hours and after that they could be released as early as the 3rd day, but this could go up to the maximum of 7 business days. Also, the more checks that are deposited in the Account, along with other factors, this timeline could shorten\".Going back and forth with this issue, I had to explain in different ways that 1) This is not a personal check but a Cashiers Ck. and funds had been already verified and withdrawn from clients bank account 2)Check was issued to my company and not an individual, and that my account has never had a returned check nor was to be put on hold as the account isn't red flagged for fraud. Went back and forth again via email with a Rep. that received an email from me where I explained what was going on and he was professional enough to advise that was going to relay this info to the \"Check Team' and see if they could do or assist on providing a more in depth explanation or solution to this issue. Never received an email from the Check Team letting me know what was the status of or if there was any possibility of a solution. Bottom line, I was told the Cashiers Check I deposited on January 4th, 2024 before noon, will be available on Thursday 11th, 2024 at the end of the day?  I am very disappointed and definitely ready to cancel the account I have with NorthOne. Bank isn't qualified to offer solutions to matters like this one nor offers the level of customer service satisfaction by going the extra mile on trying to resolve customers account concerns/issues/. As a business owner the above showed us that facts speak louder than words!.",

        "company_response_content": "Thank you for reaching out and I\u2019m sorry to hear about this frustrating experience. Certainly understand your irritations with the mobile deposit hold time. I\u2019d like to clarify how our mobile check deposit process works.With each mobile check deposit, it goes through a manual review to determine the hold time for that particular check. Checks deposited using the in-app Mobile Deposit service are generally made available within three business days from the day of deposit, but could take up to five to seven business days. In this case, I do see that this particular deposit is set to be made available five business days after the day of the deposit. Factors that affect the speed with which your funds become available may include: the length and extent of your relationship with NorthOne, amount of historical transaction information, having a history of returned checks, and more. I recommend reviewing our full terms for more insight into all factors that can be reviewed for an in-app mobile check deposit and its availability. You can reference section E.11 of NorthOne\u2019s\u00a0Deposit Account Agreement for a full breakdown on this.Thank you for your understanding here. If you have any further questions regarding this deposit, you can contact our Support team via in-app chat Support, Monday-Friday from 9:00am-6:00pm EST, or if you'd prefer, can schedule a phone call once logged into your Account.NorthOne Customer Care",

        "company_response_content": "Hi there, Thank you so much for taking the time to reach out to us. We are truly sorry for the trouble here. I have looked into your case specifically and see you have already chatted with our support team about this. As you know, deposits from Cash App, even instant ones, will take 1-3 business days to reflect in your NorthOne account.Currently, instant transfers are not supported using your NorthOne Mastercard\u00ae Debit Card. This, unfortunately, includes CashApp, Venmo, and Apple Pay. We have received lots of feedback about this and are actively looking into methods of supporting this in the future. In the meantime, while we develop an instant transfer feature, we would encourage you to not send instant transfers through CashApp.When going through the flow in CashApp, the application still allows you to set up an instant transfer to your NorthOne card, but the funds will take the same amount of time as a standard transfer (1-3 business days) and CashApp will still charge the instant fee.We suggest linking your bank account instead of your card, and only using the free standard transfer method to avoid incurring fees with CashApp.We certainly understand how this could cause an inconvenience and we do apologize for the trouble this may have caused you. Once we do have an instant transfer feature set up with some of our integrations, we will absolutely let all customers know.Thanks so much for your understanding. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us in-app. We\u2019re happy to help where we can.NorthOne Customer Experience",

I called Radius Bank, who is partnered with NorthOne, and they confirmed my account is still open, in good standing, and that I can still use my account. The rep on the phone also hinted at the fact that NorthOne is awful, but couldn't directly say it. How on earth can a \"bank\" not have any line of communication with customers, lock them out of their accounts for weeks, offer no transparency with \"updates\", and act like everything is fine. NorthOne can get bent. I've filed complaints with the BBB and the Federal Reserve. DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH THEM!Edit: Their reply to me is a fat lie. They have not communicated with me further than the initial email and conveniently chose to not address the fact that Radius Bank, their partner, even stated that my account is still active and not closed.

Since then the bank has basically deducted all $50.00 out of my account and is now going backwards $5.00 a day so now its overdrawn, I don't know how much cause I'm locked out, hopefully tens of thousands of dollars lol. Its now almost a year later and I still get emails from them but with no response to my concerns except to let me know my locked account is overdrawn, great business model guys, would have preferred if you just closed it like you did to some other people on here.

I did absolutely nothing to deserve the closure of my account. These app developers have no clue what personalized customer service means. If they did care about customer service, someone would call me to explain why they closed my account. Instead, they have a lawyer and a public relations writer respond to my critical review.

They sent the check to a third party company to cash. I waited and waited no money was deposited. Meanwhile they stopped using the 3rd party company. I\u2019m still fighting to get my $4,500.00 back from them. They told me to work with the third party company to get my money back. You have to make an appointment to talk to an actual person, which takes about a week. They have email and chat that rarely works correctly. They do not have business checks. I feel they are shady and fraudulent for cashing my check then giving me the run around to try to track it down.",

They are a financial technology company ...essentially an app. You cant call anyone, you have to make an appointment thru the app and generally appointments are not available the same day. I opened this account, made a cash deposit to open. Then made a check deposit to test the system out ( for hold times etc). They immediately rejected the check ( no reason given) -cash was fine thou- and locked the account! Now the cash deposit is not available for withdrawal. they sent an email to answer alot of questions about my business. People, one of the questions was how do we get clients? - are you kidding me!!? Um, none of your business. They charged the 10.00 fee immediately upon depositing the cash . This appears to be a scam to charge a fee. My guess is they will hold the cash deposit and will finish \"the review\" after they charge more fees against the cash deposit. I only deposited 100.00 cash - which is now frozen. Imagine if you deposited a larger amount and then they just decide to block the account and its next to impossible to speak to someone. STAY AWAY. or your money could be frozen for no apparent reason and then they will ask you to answer 100 questions ( personal questions) about your business. Almost like they would then use the info for other purposes. Very sketchy. NORTHONE I would suggest you unblock the account or you'll spend your time doing damage control on posts like these.",

My funds were frozen and I was locked out my account. I received an email from Northone stating \"We have decided to suspend your account until an account review is completed.\" I was told I needed to submit a questionnaire, invoices explaining my business, and information on my other bank accounts in order to continue to use their services. The bank had been fully aware of my line of business for more than a year after signing up and I operated my account the same way until this day. According to them this is something \"all financial services companies do\". No other bank has ever attempted this that I have dealt with. It was not until I threatened them with legal action that they immediately unlocked my account.Numerous payments that I had tied to my account were missed causing me to work over the weekend to rectify the situation and use my other bank accounts that I thankfully had for my business. Judging by complaints here on BBB this has happened recently to many of their customers. I have no desire to do business with this bank especially with their services being offered through the The Bancorp Bank Holding Company which is being sued by investors for similar liquidity issues that recently brought down Silicon Valley Bank.",

It is very hard to get ahold of them by phone, so you have to send a chat and most time the reason are not there. My account is closed now. I had 47.17 in that account because I deposit $40.00. now it was left at $37.17. They took my $10.00 on 10/25/2022. I want my money refunded. Now they are saying they will not give me a refund. Ya'll is pathetic stilling people money and putting in your pocket. The next step is Attorney General office or seek to sue them over $10.00.I got their response; you sure know how to clean up your reason, it to make it look like its customer fault.

The additional bill you see in October is your October fee. When you sign up for a NorthOne account you agree to the Deposit Account Agreement, which includes a monthly fee of $10. As you have already let the team know you wish to close your account, no further action is required at this time.

After having the account for a few weeks, I can no longer login and then I get an email saying the acct is under review on 8/27. Now 2 weeks later, the same scripted reply that the account is under review. No one with a business can tolerate blocked access to their business banking account for days, let alone weeks. I think that NorthOne is a functioning scam and the positive reviews can't be real at all.UPDATE: Its now 3 months later and not one word from NorthOne on the status of their review or my account. So this just further shows the kind of company NorthOne is. They have kept the account locked for over 3 months. They have failed to communicate anything to me, but they have no problem with spamming me with 3rd party deals. Any inquiry to them generates the same pre-made email about how the security of their customers is their primary concern, which is quite rich because it looks to me like their customers are inconsequential to them and they are only protecting themselves. What from, you ask? No way to know, they won't share any info with their \"customer\" a.k.a. guinea pig for whatever scam they are running. This is not a made-up review; everything I have said is based on exactly what they have done. If you care about your money, get as far away from NorthOne as possible!",

They will scam, do not trust them.It took time for my account to get set up and for my card to be received and I asked that the month not start until everything was ready and finalized but they went on charging me.  I didn't like the services and the lack support and perks they offered so I asked them to stop charging me per month and close my account at this point.They instead have continued to charge me per month and have drained the account even though I asked to to stop and close my account. There customer support is practically non existent and it feels as if they are trained to avoid you instead of help you. Imagine that!!!  I have been trying to reach customer service through their online chat portal and have no luck. It takes an hour to get connected then to send one message. I also looked for their phone support and have gotten nowhere. Nonexistent!They are so beyond ridiculous and deserve negative starts not even one star. I expect them to read this and fix this terrible experience or I will file a complain and not just a review.:This is a follow up edit on the review after NorthOne decided to respond.:I clearly asked on April 29th to stop getting charged fees. I did not receive any reply or help for that request. NorthOne are conveniently making themselves seem like they did the right thing and I have emails showing that to be a lie. Nice try but I stand by my review and am disgusted by NorthOne services and lies. Be ashamed of yourselves. This follow up response is a joke just like your terrible lack of customer support and your extravagant ways of wasting consumers precious time. Pay me back my hard earned money and scam yourselves in bankruptcy. Cheaters!",

I see that you reached out to our team on April 29th, one month after opening your account, on March 29th, about being charged the first monthly fee, of which is agreed upon paying when you sign up. Our team let you know that this fee is standard and you did not continue the conversation. You reached out again June 24th stating you never got a reply and that your card came very late after sign up, when our team comfirmed with you that the card was activated 5 business days after account opening, as expected. During this outreach you shared that you wanted to close your account, at which point our team closed it for you. However, the fees already incurred would not be returned, as agreed upon in your signup.I also understand you mention it was difficult to get ahold of our team, however our typical response time during business hours is less than 10 min to get a reply and we are open 7 days a week to assist customers via chat and email. You can also schedule a call 7 days a week through your NorthOne application. We do value customer communications and each time you reached out, our team was able to respond, though often times our responses went unread or replied to by you which is why your account was not closed sooner. I understand that this may not be the response you want, but we appreciate your understanding.  ",

My account was set quickly after a few more inquiries. I still feel that should have a customer service number for inquiring potential customers. But, they were so quick to respond to my concerns that maybe they don't?  I've changed my reviews from 1 star to 5.---------------------------------------------------I applied with two different online business banks, and one of them was NorthOne. I never heard back from them until I attempted to login to check and see if I could find out the status. Once logged in, they directed me to the option to make a deposit. So maybe they did approve my account?? I went through the deposit process and got the message that they needed to verify more information and that should be completed in 24 hours. That took 3 additional days.They have a number (332) 205-9253, and when you call it, it tells you to either make an appointment with a customer rep or email customer service.  I emailed them, and long story short, because my email wasn't the same as the one I applied with, they couldn't answer any questions. I explained the email that applied with was an alias to my business email address, and that I'd be happy to provide any other information they needed, or can I please talk to someone.  I was told the number is for customers only and that I need to email them from the email address that I applied for the account with.  I was frustrated. First, I waited days to get a reply. Then, when I logged in, I found that they were ready for me to go to the next step which was make a deposit -- only to be told that I will need to wait an additional 24 hours for whatever else they needed to verify... The 24 hours turned into 72. So, I needed to call my hosting company to get my email name changed, which I did. convoluted Once I did that, I called and requested they terminate the application.

I have not been able to talk to a person nor gotten any responses to the 8 emails I have sent to \"customer support\" I DO NOT recommend trusting NorthOne with your small business banking. I will never use an online only bank again. Its been a terrible experience and not worth $15/month in banks fees I was going to save. If you want access to your funds DO NOT trust NorthOne with them. They are liars, they replied once on Facebook that they emailed me. I guess its somewhat true I got 4 emails asking me to refer new customers to them. But 0 emails or communication regarding my locked account or their outright ignoring me for 48 hours. They will steal your money for no reason and ignore your attempts to contact them. On a side note its probably not great marketing to ask for referrals from someone you just stole money from and are now ignoring. But I did listen and have been giving feedback about how they stole my money are now ignoring me to anyone looking for a new bank. **** I deposited a business check from a fortune 500 company into my business checking account. 5 days after locking account they now want me to prove that check was actually paid to me. They want invoices, They asked how I got the check, like did I find it and randomly try cashing it? It's written to my business from a business there is no suspicious activity. Yet they come at me as though I stole the check and am cashing a check that isn't mine. More so than ever I believe NorthOne is a scam and out to hurt small business. DO NOT trust them with your money. I have no idea how long it will take me to prove my businesses money is mine and get it back. They will ignore you and make you jump through circus hoops to prove your money is yours.***** I still do not recommend NorthOne, my entire experience was terrible and their random locking of accounts for illegitimate and illegal reasons can destroy a small business. I received my check for the funds in my were in my account via 2 day UPS so they can get your money back to you in a timely manner. If you make enough noise. I commented on the CEO's linkedin page and posted public comments on facebook posts to finally get them responding to me. I promised to continue commenting publicly until I had my money returned.",

        "comment_content": "So I\u2019m an online marketer/freelancer that partakes and earns income from multiple opportunities online, referring to family/friends. I joined this app a few days ago to use and refer to others as well; they were running a $75 referral bonus for each successful person who signs up and deposits $50. So I joined and followed those instructions and received a few sign ups. Then the next day I was emailed that my account was suspended til I could provide documentation about my business and answer some of their questions. Inconvenience considering my account was accepted already, but I did as they requested and provided my information, answered their questions, and sent payment proof that I do earn income online from my business and sent some social media links so they could see exactly what it is I do (even though I did explain) Fast forward to Today, my account is closed & I can\u2019t access the app/login and the person I\u2019ve been speaking to hasn\u2019t provided me any legitimate reason as to WHY my account was closed. Like she doesn\u2019t care; I had to mention I was going to the BBB (which I am) if I don\u2019t receive my money! Only then after mentioning that, did she say they would mail me a check! I\u2019m awaiting her response as of now\u2026 not sure if the check is only for my deposit or for my sign on bonus/referral pay as well. Because she didn\u2019t mention so. Support is BAD. (At least with this woman it is) Us marketers know each other, we talk. This is unfair treatment, sketchy, stealing, & bad business. We did the work; least they could do is honor their referral program and pay us. So that\u2019s why I give NorthOne Bank a 1 star.UPDATE 11/12/2021, after NorthOne\u2019s reply: I received the exact same response from y\u2019all that other\u2019s have received; y\u2019all have provided no additional info, simply copying & pasting scripts to everyone to make yourself seem professional, however still not answering our concerns as to why y\u2019all are shutting down accounts left & right and not paying people what\u2019s due to them; this is not good business! (PS, that link\u2026 yall modified last week AFTER I & others joined\u2026 stating, \u201cyou can refer to close, personal family and friends only\u201d which is what I do!) So either way, I followed your rules, yet y\u2019all don\u2019t wanna honor your own referral program! That\u2019s sad. Y\u2019all \u2018tricked\u2019 a bunch of people, including myself, into joining & depositing $50 and then turn around and suspend & eventually shut down our accounts, AFTER we submit to y\u2019all personal/sensitive info like our driver\u2019s license and ssn! If that\u2019s not suspicious I don\u2019t know what is. Also! Y\u2019all claim to have sent me a check (which I have not received & I\u2019m still waiting on) And y\u2019all haven\u2019t even responded back to my email where I request a photo copy of the check (cause I wasn\u2019t told how much the check would be for) and tracking. ? So I can send y\u2019all details that y\u2019all claim you need to help reinstate my account (tho y\u2019all closed it)!! but y\u2019all can\u2019t send me proof of sending my check? What BS. Seems one sided, don\u2019t it? (For anyone reading this) I do NOT recommend trying NorthOne. Most people, including myself, are displeased!- I did file a claim with the BBB.",

        "comment_content": "Based on my experience thus far, NorthOne is shady, at best, and a total fraud, at worst. I signed up thinking this would be a great banking app for my marketing needs. Deposited $50 and a few hours later, they suspended my account. Asked me to provide supporting documentation, which I did. Today, they closed my account with no reason as to why. They haven't responded to my replies, and it appears they're attempting to keep my $50 deposit as there was no mention of returning it to me in their correspondence. I also acquired referral signups but they appear not to be honoring those, either.Update after NorthOne's reply: I've received this same canned response AFTER I made several attempts to find out why they pulled a \"bait and switch\" routine. NorthOne has offered nothing new in this canned reply. In fact, they offered even less today. In their replies to me after I repeatedly asked them for an explanation, they refused to give me specifics as to why they closed my account after accepting my deposit and approving my account. They sent me a link to their referral terms/conditions, which they just modified last week to state \"you can refer to close, personal friends and family only.\" Meanwhile, NorthOne advertises their signup/referral bonuses on sites such as Swagbucks, so there's no reason to believe that referring their promotion is something they did not want. What's clear is that NorthOne DID NOT want to honor their signup or referral bonus offerings, as they duped countless people - myself included - into applying for an account and depositing $50, and then suspended and closed the accounts.. Meanwhile, they now have copies of my driver's license, my SSN and other sensitive information.NorthOne claims to have sent me a check after I repeatedly inquired about it. I asked for proof of this and they have yet to provide me any proof, and I have still not received a check.Update 11/17/21 - It's been 8 days since NorthOne told me they were sending me a check to refund the $50 I deposited when signing up. I haven't received the check, and I asked about it this morning, to which \"Paulie\" replied, \"we advise that you please review the Account Agreement from here.\"Update 5/31/22 - I finally received my check weeks after having to demand it from Northone.  I truly believe they would've kept my deposit had I not fought tooth-and-nail to get it back.  I also found that my original review back in November was removed, and they've got several suspicious 5-star reviews which I believe are from employees.  There's also one 3-star review and their reply encouraged the reviewer to change it to 5-star.  Shady and desperate.  Despite them seemingly trying to stack the deck with fake 5-star reviews, the 1-star genuine reviews are still coming in on this company's shady business practices.Based on my experience, I strongly warn against doing business with this awful company.Update 6/4/22 - The reply they gave to this is the same canned reply they gave on my original review, which they somehow got removed, hence this re-review.  I spent weeks going back and forth with them via email.  Out of all the people I spoke to, there was only one rep who was actually apologetic over the situation and professional.  All the others were as ridiculous as their reply to this review is.",

All was going well until I was notified one day that my referral link had been removed and more information was requested about my business.  Confused about this I replied back to NorthOne that I had already provided the requested information during sign up and was only told, \"All banks occasionally review customer accounts...\".  I still found this odd, but complied with their request and provided the requested information the next day.  After I provided the information, I was told \"Your referral link has been removed and will not be reactivated\" in spite of me providing everything they asked for.  When I inquired why I was being treated with such disdain and accusatory nature, the support only replied that they could not tell me why my link was revoked, and simply referred me to their terms of service.  I read over the terms and nothing in them applied to me in any way.  This occurred after I referred two people who are also small business owners to the bank.  It appears they removed my link so that they would not have to pay the referral bonuses.  Having not broke ANY of their rules or terms this is the only logical explanation. I've never in my life seen such scamming tactics utilized by a legitimate bank.  It's shameful.edit: After reading some of the other reviews, I feel slightly better to know that I wasn't singled out and that  NorthOne is just an awful scam ridden bank.  I find it amusing they have this canned response:\"All financial service companies are required to evaluate their products, services and customers periodically.\" (I also received this response when engaging with customer service via email).My Lili small business banking account has never treated me this way so they can keep this awful canned response to themselves.",

I called ahead to make sure that there was one available and was told that there were three, so we went right in. We went to let a teller know that we needed to speak to a loan officer, and then sat in the waiting area for 25 minutes while employees walked through the waiting area--no one making eye contact or saying anything. After the 25 minutes, a manager came out and asked if we had been helped, and if we had told a teller that we were there. After that a loan officer (Jorge) helped us draw up papers. Our 2nd visit was to finalize our transaction. I had emailed Jorge the day before to let him know what time we were able to come in. We peeked in to see if Jorge was busy, and he helped us immediately. I would give this visit 5 stars! Jorge was very friendly,  and everything went very well!I have confidence that in the future, employees will be aware of customers in the waiting room.",

I sat up to Camping World for hours thinking it was them that was the issue but it turns out it was this credit union. Nothing was said until almost three hours later that the loan initiator did not have all the information. Three hours I will never get back. But after that he really stepped up to make sure things flew through. On the billing side of things...also super slow. Just got my info to pay my bill 4 days prior to the due date, Makes me nervous...I always pay my bills well before they are due. But the web site is pretty awesome and easy to set up. Overall not bad just slow on things I think should be addressed as being quicker.Thanks!",

        "comment_content": "Today I had one of the best customer service experiences ever at EGCU. It was found my debit card had been compromised and needed to be replaced. I went to the credit union on Broadway in South Portland and as I stood there waiting for a new card I had a great conversation with both the teller working on my issue and another who was waiting for customers. Both were so professional, courteous, and genuinely kind. Not because that's their job but because they sincerely cared and it was apparent. Later at home I had to make a call back to the CU due to an issue updating a site with recurring billing using the new card. I experienced exactly the same level of attention and caring. There came a point where I was so overwhelmed and moved by this I asked who to reach out to there so I could be sure they received my gratitude. I have been a loyal EGCU customer for over 20 years. If anyone asked me to recommend a place to do their banking EGCU is unmatched. When I dealt with staff today I wasn't being waited on at a business. I felt like I was part of a family. Kudos to Evergreen Credit Union for providing stellar customer service and showing just how much they care about their patrons!",

When we applied for a PPP loan a few years ago in 2000, we spoke with Julie Littell, and every word was focused and efficient. I thought, boy would I love to hire her away. I didn't try of course, but that was the level that I saw her at.As far as the PPP forgiveness application, I figured it would be the gargantuan probe of my finances. That's fine, but I hate document gathering. So I procrastinated until after sending 2-3 emails. Kevin Sullivan  finally called me and walked me through the process. Basically he said click a couple buttons. They had already done all the work for me. All the form and what was required was essentially done. All I had to do was review and approve it. Mr. Sullivan was just as efficient as Ms. Littell, and I am starting to realize that it is their culture.I am so glad that I have been with Evergreen Credit Union. Thank you Ms. Littell and Mr. Sullivan, for making the experience as smooth as was physically possible. I am so impressed.",

After a 5 minute phone, I was sure that I could get a rate that I wanted for a time duration I expected and had an appointment on a Saturday morning as soon as the doors opened. After 10 minutes I had a check in had to go purchase my vehicle and confident that the loan was everything I expected. The rate was better than the dealerships I had been dealing with and was in my new vehicle by noon.If my other experiences buying a vehicle were ever this great I would want to buy a new vehicle every year.",

After opening the account I started slowly using them. I wanted a new camper and asked about a loan. They made the process so easy. I secured a loan with them. Just last week I decided to switch my direct deposit and move all my banking needs to them. I have been with my old bank for over 20yrs and am usually loyal.

Our intended purpose is for children to learn key financial skills for any future financial responsibility. In regards to the interest rate imposed by the parent account, this is something you can opt out of paying, but we understand that this is a healthy and common interest from standard bank accounts. As we are a financial service and not a bank, we don't operate in the same way and therefore cannot offer this type of interest that aligns with standard US bank accounts. I hope this continues to be a key supporter for your children in allowing them to be financially independent and stable in the future, and if you have any further queries please do contact us via our dedicated customer support lines - (877) 372-6466 / help@gohenrycard.com.

They love being able to make purchases for their games online, having the card to use, and being able to monitor their earnings/savings on the ap. I like them being able to have a little autonomy with their money but also being able to set limits and monitor what they spend. These will be very convenient for overnight trips or amusement park trips so I can monitor what they have spent and add money if needed without having to worry about them keeping track of enough cash for several days. I was very disappointed in how long it took for the cards to arrive. Cards arrived MUCH later than indicated when the order was placed and they do not track them, so they couldn't tell me if they were lost/stolen/delayed. The customer service rep(when I tried to contact them about the delayed cards) was very dismissive and not helpful. I would rate the cards a 4, but the experience in getting them and customer service a 1.",

        "comment_content": "We love the this app and debit card system so far and the user experience is really high quality. I particularly like the way we can incorporate family members in the learning process and open the door for more thoughtful monetary gifts. I do, however, have a few suggestions to help make it even better for our family.1. Paced missions - once my son figured out that missions came with a monetary incentive, he became obsessed with finishing them and burned through them as fast as he could without taking much in. I wish the lessons were paced and tied to his activities and age. If the app stopped him from moving forward in his lessons until he reached a specific money milestone, he might be more receptive to the teachable moment. For example, he could be presented with a lesson on saving after a few months of using the app, along with with a challenge to start saving more. Basically, there should be prerequisites for unlocking additional lessons and they should use the interactions and age of the child to provide more guidance. For example, the lessons in the second stage were way above his head shouldn\u2019t have been available until he\u2019s within the recommended age range for them which shouldn\u2019t be difficult since the app knows he\u2019s 6. If anticipating the needs of so many different children is difficult, then  parents should have the option to lock milestones until they feel their child is ready for them. Then they could be part of an intentional process of parents guiding their kids through money lessons tied directly to lived experiences.2. I struggled a bit in setting up the allowance and tasks along with the allowance schedule. We first got the app on a Saturday and that is my son\u2019s allowance day. I couldn\u2019t get the app to send him his allowance same day and we had to wait a week to have it transfered based on his task activity. I wish there was a way to override the schedule at times and \u201cgive allowance now.\u201d Also, I wish we could look back at a calendar of previous allowances to reflect on his wins and challenges.3. Lastly I wish the giving section allowed us to identify a charity of our choice.",

In regards to the Allowances, I understand that you activated your account and set up this Allowance on a Saturday, which is the chosen Allowance day. As this was the day the account was created, the system would not have taken the Allowance into the hourly runs and therefore this is why it would have kicked in for the following Saturday.

I specifically didn\u2019t sign up for another one for this reason\u2026they asked up front so I went with yours only to find you ask later on. Because you did I can see I don\u2019t trust you with my children and will not allow them to use the app\u2026we just use this as our method to check chores and. I thing more.

Your feedback is important to us as we are always keen to understand our customer's needs and improve our services if possible.We understand that a monthly fee can be a sticking point for some and if we could be free, we would be. As GoHenry is a financial service rather than a bank, we do not make any money off debt or interest. Charging a small fee for the service allows us to continue adding and improving unique features on the app to make our members & their families learn money skills for life.Of course, it's not for everyone and we respect that. Here is a link to some further insight into what our membership fee includes: https://www.gohenry.com/us/pricing/Kind regards,Ella (GoHenry Supervisor)",

Our cards would also give you a rough idea of where your child is due to the real-time spending notifications.

It is sad to hear that your children are upset at the situation, and this can understandably put yourself in a difficult position as a parent. When a new card is ordered, we usually advise it should be received in 7-10 working days, depending on USPS around your area. Once cards are dispatched from our processor, their arrival date will greatly depend on the USPS service around you. As there can be USPS delays, we would always recommend waiting 4-5 days after the estimated arrival, to ensure the original card will not arrive. We hope your children's cards arrive very soon, and should you require any further assistance with this, you are welcome to reach out to us 9-5 EST 7 days a week via phone ((877) 372-6466) & live chat for a more time-sensitive resonse. ~Sally ",

I have managed to locate your account using the details provided and will call you to discuss the issues raised later today. I can see that you have added funds to your account and this is sitting in the parent balance currently, As you chose a custom card for him then we have taken $4.99 to cover the cost of this with a $5.00 allowance set up for your child that gets paid onto his account on a weekly basis on a Monday as requested and at the moment there is $10.00 on his card. I have sent you a follow-up email with some additional information to your registered email address, Please may I ask that you review the email ready for when I  contact you to discuss the points raised. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, Many thanks and I look forward to speaking with you. Thanks Kay.",

She said the money remaining on the Go Henry card would be returned to my parent account within 3 to 5 business days. On August 2, 2023 I received an email from them stating that in order to process my refund they needed highly sensitive and private information about my bank account. (See the email pasted below.)Their email did NOT provide a secure way to provide this information even if I wanted to. The option they offered was to email them back - in broad daylight - all my account information or call them and give it to a representative.They already had my bank account information. How else was I paying the $4.99/mo plus putting money on the card for our child?Why did they need me to give them this sensitive information again and without any security measures? They could just send the remaining funds on the Go Henry card back to the bank account that was on file with them.I called and spoke with a rep at Go Henry. He was not helpful and put me on hold a couple of times. He kept saying he was sorry, but they must get my bank account information before I could get my $158 back.I said, no you were able to withdraw the monthly membership fee and receive funds from the bank account on record, you have that information and I am not going to send account numbers, routing numbers, and my bank name in an email, nor am I going to give that private information to a total stranger verbally.I hung up and called my bank here in the US. Once she understood the circumstances she said, no do not give that information in an email or to someone over the phone. She also said Go Henry can certainly refund our $158.00 right back to the checking debit card I used with them. So she affirmed what I told the Go Henry rep. There was no reason they could not send the funds left on the card back to our bank. They did not need account and routing numbers.I called Go Henry back again and what do you know - I got the same Rep as before. I told him what my bank said and he insisted that in order to get my money returned I would have to respond with all the information they wanted from me as stated in their email.Anybody with an eighth of a brain knows it is nuts to send this information in an email or give it to a stranger over the phone. Identity theft is rampant around the world. It's essential that we are vigilant and smart about handing over financial information to anyone.Whenever I've dealt with other companies about needing my banking information that's already on file with them they've only asked for the last four digits of the account to confirm they have the correct account, or my last four social and/or mother's maiden name.This is the protocol for preventing digital theft and fraud.Decide for yourself how you would handle the email I got from Go Henry shown below. Hi xxxx,I hope you are well.  In order for us to process your refund, could you please provide us with the following information: Account NameChecking Account Number ACH Number Bank NameTo help find this information, please  see your options below: Option 1: ACH stands for Automated Clearing House To find your ACH routing number, first, check your checkbook. It may be the nine-digit number to the left of your account number  Option 2: Find the Routing Number on your bank's websiteYour routing number is associated with your bank and its location. One bank may have many different routing numbers for different locations. This website can assist should you require it how-do-i-find-my-ach-routing-number I understand this may be frustrating, but we want to ensure the funds do reach your account.

If you have a funding card linked to your GoHenry account, we are only able to return a certain amount against this, and within a certain timeframe. If a loading card has not been used in some time, or the amount to return is greater, then we are only able to action this via ACH transfer. As the ACH information we have requested will only allow us to pay funds into your checking account, not withdraw or action anything further, this is not classed as sensitive information, and we are required to request it to return the remaining funds from a closure. We appreciate your bank's input, however for the reasons set out above, and via email to you upon the request of this information, we are unable to return directly to your card. We understand that under certain circumstances this may be possible, but this is not the case, and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by this.As we are unable to locate your account using the information provided with this review, we would advise that should you wish to discuss this further, you reach out to us via email and include 'FAO Supervisors' in the title. Alternatively you are able to call us 9-5 EST 7 days a week, and our agents would be happy to take the ACH information from you for your refund. ~Sally",

        "comment_content": "The very first transfer to my daughters account for $25.00 seemed fine.  However, on her very first purchase for $7.00 Henry's \"Front end ledger\" immediately showed my daughters balance as being negative -13.00 or so.  And I say front end ledger that is provided to the parents and children.      goHenry then proceeded on from this incorrect number, while I had been unable to access the account do to some wonky app errors It was not caught right away.  My daughter was set to be in my sisters wedding and i attempted transfer of $200 the day before she was to get her hair and makeup done.      While this money is directly drawn from my account on a thursday morning I expected it to be available in time.      It was not until the 5th day when no money had appeared that I called and learned about goHenrys use of two ledgers on kids accounts while never failing to take a fee While I had to shell put another $200 in order for my daughter to be ready for the wedding, this was the easy part.       What I didn't understand is that if this card is to help you teach your kids about money, how do you explain to them that to begin 25 minus 7 is NOT -13.        And when I posed the simple question to the folks at goHenry who assured me that both the back end ledger and the front end ledger showed the correct amount.  They dodged the question, and it's a very simple one.   \"If the account began with an incorrect number, and continued on without adjusting the starting number how could it ever be the correct amount?\" It's funny math.   25- 7 does NOT equal negative 13.  Therefore  Everything from -13 forward was incorrect.       And then one has to be concerned with two different ledgers, in any event for kids debit cards, or the lack of a cap on how negative goHenry will apparently let a child go.  Which as a parent I could have had such a conversation except I did not receive a single text alert for my child's account.  Although I would be notified when my fees were taken, or there was not enough in the account for allowance.     And then there is the stated purpose of the card which is to teach my child money management However, with this debit cards just a glance at the statement one immediately knows they need a forensic accountant to sort it out let alone teach.     And this all occurred over the span of about 5 months or so.   Oh yeah and the account was closed in May without notifying me, not that I intended to keep it open. But it's now the middle of July and I still have not gotten the $200 back,  excuse me the 175.00 because they took more fees and claimed the account was negative.    So if you want to sit on hold for an inordinate amount of time something like an hour and a half when I was 8th in the queue to be stonewalled, by some very polite folks with British accents this is your place. But remember if they have your account info they can take money all day, but ask why they can't put it back the way they took it. So I'm likely going to have to sit another hour and a half just to get my money back.",

As a financial provider, the timescales for some procedures, for example a paycheck to clear into one of our accounts, may differ from what a standard bank may provide. Any wages paid in from a teen's employer will normally take 2-3 working days to clear through the employer's bank, then GoHenry's bank, and be applied to the account in question. As much as funds may credit sooner than this occasionally, this is the standard timescale we would recommend. While we strive to ensure wages clear and apply in a timely manner, there may be occasions where a weekend, holiday, or something similar, push this process out by a day. We have been unable to locate your account using the information provided here, however please do reach out to us at help@gohenrycard.com with the title FAO SUPERVISORS, so that one of our Supervisor team can respond to you.

Please rest assured we have looked into this for you.    When GoHenry card information is entered online for a free trial or similar recurring subscription service, the merchant will hold the card information. They do this so that they can provide their services to the cardholder seamlessly each month (or yearly depending on the type of subscription selected). In any circumstance where a merchant holds card information, we would always recommend reaching out to them, as they shall be able to cancel any possible subscriptions/recurring charges and put a permanent stop to that service moving forwards. We can confirm that as a prepaid allowance card, it is not possible for GoHenry to cancel or suspend any subscriptions set up on our cards from our side. Our advice would be to reach out to the individual merchants.We shall be happy to go through this in more detail with you. If you do have any questions regarding our email, please do let us know, and we will happy to schedule a call with you. Many thanks,Sally ",

I've been using it for two weeks now, and have run into a couple frustrating bugs. If the app was free, I would put up with it, but with a monthly subscription I hope for better quality. ISSUE: The scheduled payment days for my child haven't ever been paid on the correct day/time it says it will. I've had to manually transfer the money onto his card, which wouldn't be a big deal, but it interferes with scheduled weekly tasks he has to complete for $$. I hope this issue is corrected soon.",

She had just had her birthday and I added all her birthday money from family members to Go Henry. Transactions were coming out then going back in and then out again and a lump sum also disappeared. I emailed, no response, I went on their online chat and they ended it abruptly, I called and waited for an email follow up. There response was poor and full of excuses. Before all of this, my kids complained how Go Henry would increase the cost of a transaction in case they were going to leave a tip or something. The issue is that sometimes they only had the exact money for what they wanted in their account but Go Henry would reject it for insufficient funds. Go Henry is not great for kids and has left my daughter very upset and angry and they are getting away with it.",

I made sure funds were available before he would purchase anything. Once the option became available for him to add the card to his AppleWallet things went downhill VERY quickly. My son uses his card at school at the vending machines. GoHenry claims that for weeks they were processing payments and not taking the funds leading my son to believe more money was on his card than he actually had. He hasn\u2019t used the card since realizing his spending limit was negative and the negative amount keeps going up. At this point I just want to cancel the card because I\u2019d hate to settle the account and these charges aren\u2019t even valid. Based on the reviews I\u2019ve read regarding the customer service department trying that sounds like a waste of time and a lost cause.

I had to call support while making her first purchase because they immediately put a fraud alert on it and I had to call and verify that it was us that made the purchase. It was just too much which is why I decided to switch to GoHenry.The only thing I\u2019d change is the option to auto add funds into my parent account on a certain day. For example getting $20 added to my parent account every 2 weeks from my account on file vs. money only being added once my parent account gets below a certain amount.Granted I can add money to my parent account as needed, but it would be nice to have it auto add on my payday so that I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it. I also like that there\u2019s an app for both parent and child. My 6 year old can easily navigate the app and check off on her tasks in order for her to get her allowance every week.

I reported fraud on my grandsons card on April 19, 2023 and as of today June 6, 2023 there has been no resolution.  When I initially found the fraud I tried calling, but it was 7:00 pm on a Friday so mo one was there.  I then sent an email immediately.   It took a week and a half before my email was answered.  In the meantime while waiting for an email answer, I called during business hours and a very nice gentleman helped me. He cancelled my grandsons card and was going to issue a new one & get the fraud claim started.  So I'm thinking I'll be getting the money back in a timely matter.  Then 3 days later I get an email that it'll be at least 45 days to get my money back as thats how long they give the companies to respond.  This is totally unacceptable.   I'm not unreasonable, I expected a week or 2.  This is total B.S. at this point. There are no updates at all during this time either. I highly recommend that you find some other service because this sucks.  And anyone who reads this and is with this company I sincerely hope there is never any fraud on your childrens account.",

We have managed to locate your account with the details provided and we have tried to reach out to you on 10/06/2023 by call and email regarding the concerns you state in your review, however we have still been unable to speak with you directly. As we are a financial service and not a bank, our dispute process can take longer than we would like to be resolved, but we do need to give the merchant ample time to be able to review the dispute and raise any concerns with us which is why you were advised of the 45 working day timescale once we received your paperwork back and processed on the 2nd May 2023.  We would love to be able to speak to you about the process , so please do reply to the email that we have sent with a suitable time that we can contact you to hopefully resolve your concerns. We'll try to contact you again on Monday if we have not received a reply.We look forward to hearing back from you soon.Many thanks, Kay ",

        "comment_content": "Fraud not addressed after a month of fraudulent charges!! My 2 kids have had an account with this company for over a year and everything was ok until one day I got a text alert notifying me that my son's account was $-400+!! I immediately called and wanted it straightened out. I was told that they just found out about this \"glitch\" and were \"working hard to fix it\". There was no block put on the card and over the next week we watched money be credited back and then charged again and again.I called them a week later to find out what was going on. I was told I would be put on a \"watch list\" and when the account was straightened out I would be notified. I asked for my account to be closed and was told that was impossible until it was straightened out. Frustrated I agreed. I noticed they STILL did not block funds on his card so I personally put a block on it to try to salvage SOME of his money. Why on Earth they didn't do this to begin with as any normal institution would I have no idea!! 2 weeks later I'm still seeing charges be attempted to my son's account but as I blocked it they are not gong through (thankfully). I called them this morning to demand my account be credited back and closed. Once again I got the \"I apologize for your inconvenience\" garbage (but the CSR was very kind btw), and there is nothing they can do until it's been straightened out! I was able to cancel my daughter's card and have that credited back to my bank account...... we'll see if that happens.... but my son's is still in limbo.Upon speaking to my bank on the matter they referred me to the fraud department of the FDIC of which I am going to file a claim. As it is under $500 I'm not expecting much but maybe it will flag this company.If you want to use this system to pay your kids, talk to your bank!! Ours can set it up to be just like GoHenry's system AND pay interest w/o fees. That is the route we should have gone in the first place.",

The reason we have been given is that a full licence has additional checks such as attending a test centre and being present at the time of the test to verify your identity and obtaining a provisional license does not have this check in place. Our issuing bank has also confirmed that we cannot accept provisional licences to open the account.As a financial service, we are required to 'know' our customers. We carry out a widely-used check called a Know Your Customer check (KYC) to comply with our regulatory obligations. We do this check at the time of sign-up, by matching your details against a number of public record databases such as; the electoral roll, the telephone landline database and Experian. This identity check is not a credit check and does not affect your credit score in anyway, although it will show as a trace on your credit history.If you are not registered on these databases, for example you are only on the private electoral roll and not the public record, or your phone number is ex-directory, we will not be able to match your details online. Should this happen, we'll ask you to contact us with additional information to confirm your identity.I am unable to see an account attempted for you as you have not provided TP with your email address to contact you to discuss your concerns. If you would like to know what forms of ID we can accept, Please can I ask that you email us at help@gohenrycard.com with the subject heading FAO Supervisors and we will be able to assist you further.Thanks - Kay",

We are working as fast as we can to respond to all of our contacts, however, our response times have been impacted as we are experiencing an unprecedented amount of contact from our members. Please accept our sincere apology for any delay you may experience. I can see that you sent us an email on the 30th of March which our agents have responded to and also another on 12/4/2023 which is still in the queue and I have since responded to the email. I am unable to locate any calls from your number, Im afraid I am sorry to hear that the card is not working, I have advised in the email that this is due to an issue with the terminal in the store not receiving the notification that we are wanting to approve the payment so it is automatically declining. If I can ask that you try in another store and enter the Pin Number and we can see if the card is definitely not working anymore as I can see previous successful transactions have been made. If you have any additional questions, Please reply to the email that I have sent you and we will attempt to call you later to discuss the issues you have faced. Thanks, Kay",

Which will not allow him to spend the funds unless its on his card. The card has already been activated on 04/01/2023.  I am only able to see that we have sent one card to you.

My high schooler traveled with his school and many stops have been card payment only; we\u2019re so grateful he has his Go Henry card with him and that we can trust it to work reliably.

I call the subscriber and they couldn\u2019t seem to find the subscription to cancel it. So I got in touch with GoHenry help support, I was told if I wanted to cancel it I had to go through the subscriber and I explained I tried and I thought it was a scam. They told me it appeared not to be a scam and sent me the subscriber number. I told them I had already called that and they did not help me. He said he couldn\u2019t help me either so I said I guess I will just cancel my cards because I don\u2019t know what else to do, and AS SOON AS I said that my cards were canceled that fast. I really didn\u2019t have another choice at this point and I guess I will just find my kids new debit cards somewhere else at a place that\u2019s just a tad bit nicer.",

My son plays a lot of basketball and travels consistently out of town to games and thats why we consider the GoHenry card in hitch we keep funded. The other day he called when the team went out to eat saying his card wasn\u2019t working. So I\u2019m return he had to borrow monies from his coach which in my opinion as a parent is quite embarrassing. I called GoHenry and they said that they had something go wrong with their system. I asked why wasn\u2019t the customers contacted? Why wasn\u2019t the customer aware of these situations and in return my kid almost didn\u2019t eat because of it. They had no explanation. I immediately cancelled the card. Very much a waste of time. They have a ton of work to do on the development side of things. Save time and agony and just get your child a cash app card. That is what I\u2019m going to do!",

There was 4.99 monthly per account maintenance fee and then ATM fees! I have teens, so of course they would want to withdraw money when out with their friends!I was unaware of the amount of fees because I trusted that my husband carefully did his due diligence. After noticing all the fees on their accounts from using ATM machines, I was upset.I looked for other options earlier this year and realized that JPMORGAN Chase teamed up with Greenlight and no monthly fees! They can use their card and withdraw money wherever there's a Chase ATM! That was the better option. My time is too valuable to login, add money to the parent account, then distribute it from there! When we closed the accounts, the kids had to drain their funds because we couldn't transfer them back to our bank accounts. Good luck to the parents that chose Gohenry and all the fees that comes with it!",

However if your child ever loses their card that is where the lack of customer service begins.  My daughter lost her card and we immediately reported it lost and they said we will send you a new one.  I get an email saying your card is on the way and should be there in 7-10 days.  1st red flag. No tracking number and was being delivered snail mail via USPS. My daughter is away at school and needed the card.  After 15 days i called and they ssid wait another 5 days.  I did.  Then i called again and they said sorrry would you like to reorder and i said sure.  I said can you overbight it and put a tracking number on it.  They said NO.  I said can I speak to someone who can authorize this and said no one can.  So now they want me to wait another 10-15 days and see whether I receive a replacement card.  This is not the kind of customer service I expect from financial i would suggest you not do business with this company.   BTW i asked for the CEO email address and she assured me she would send it to me and she didn\u2019t.",

        "comment_content": "In order to review this company, I am simply going to summarize my experience with it. I got this card for my 7 year old son for his birthday. I have deposited all his piggybank savings in it and he even got some money sent in the account from relatives for his birthday. I gave the card to him on his birthday. He had approximately $600 in his account and I put in around $200 in my parent account in order to pay him for chores and allowances.2 weeks later on September 30th, his account was hacked. My parental controls were changed. His pin, his spending limits, etc were all maxed out on the app. The approximately $200 in my parent account was fully transferred to his child account. Then there were two charges made on fraudulent Chinese websites that basically drained his account to near zero. After being on hold for 2 HOURS AND 30 MINS to talk to someone at your customer service that day, it took me 5-6 days to get my son's STOLEN money refunded by GoHenry and 10 days to get receive his newly issued physical card in the mail. But they refunded the entire money back to my son\u2019s account, not to the parent account. I went to the website and the FAQ  section clearly states the easiest way is to withdraw from an ATM. That's what I did. By the way, each withdrawal limit is only $100 per day. And it costs me $1.50 fee from GoHenry and $3 fee from the bank's ATM. Then after all this, instead of apologizing for all the inconveniences that was caused to me and my 7 year old, the company freezes my account without talking to me, because I withdrew money from the ATM multiple days in a row. To be frank, I do not even care, because GoHenry is unsafe for my son's funds. After 11 days, I am still waiting to receive hundreds of dollars to be refunded back to my REAL bank account. Use a real bank, not this app....",

        "comment_content": "So far I've had nothing but issues with GoHenry. I needed to update our address in order to link my debit card which reflects my new address, GoHenry required the address match my state issued driver's license which I hadn't updated yet. I told customer service I had planned on getting an updated one but that in Alaska it can take a month to get the new one in the mail so I asked if my temp would be valid, I was told yes. So I got my temporary card, called in again to update the address and was then told they in fact do not accept temporary ID's and I would have to wait for the permanent one to come in. Meanwhile my kids allowance is continuing to accumulate and so I was told I could use the gift link if I wanted to send them funds until my official DL comes in to change the billing address. I used the links and paid both my kids...who by the way are far more persistent and pressing than ANY debt collector could be. So allowances are paid...or so I thought. Apparently the funds I sent are only seen as \"gifts\" and now the app still shows I owe them allowance money (plus the extras for odd tasks and the educational quizzes they'd done). I've searched and searched but I don't see a way to remove the allowance that the app says they're still owed which is now making it appear there's a debt when I've actually paid them and now I'll have to essentially double pay in order to get back on schedule but who knows how long or how much that will be since I'm still waiting for my ID to come in. I can cancel the allowance...and the tasks...and the learning bonus...but then that doesn't let my kids actually see what they've earned which is one of the main aspects of them learning about finances. I'm just thinking I may have made the wrong call choosing GoHenry and at this point am actively looking for alternative services that may work better for us.",

I had taken a look into your account with the email provided and I can see that you have gotten in touch with us today and given your details to have the address updated in the account, which has been escalated, and a secure link will be sent within 24 hours. Under the U.S Patriot Act, we are required that we 'know our customer' and we use an online idenitfication and address verfication service to comply- therefore we can only accept either state ID or full driver's license. While looking into the account, I can see that there has been successful loads made into the account, today and 10-14-2022. The attempts before this had been declined due to the billing address mismatch. As for the allowance, until you are able to load funds into the account, you have the option to change the allowance to '$0.00' and add money manually - to do this and top the account up when and needs be: 1. Login to your GoHenry account on the app 2. Tap \u2018Money\u2019 at the bottom of the page 3. Tap on the relevant child shown at the top of your screen4. Tap the \u2018Allowance\u2019 option 5. Tap \u2018Weekly Allowance\u2019 6. Change the child\u2019s allowance amount to $0 7. Tap \u2018Save\u2019 It is disappointing to hear that you are not fully satisfied with our app. We review all feedback received to ensure we learn from the times when we don\u2019t quite get it right. If we could offer our further assistance then, please do let us know by either emailing us at help@gohenrycard.com, alternatively you can join us at LiveChat or call us at 877 372 6466. -Suvechha ",

I\u2019ve spoiled them a little and they have come to expect things when they really have done nothing to deserve it.  So far it\u2019s worked really well in teaching them how to save money and to understand that Mom isn\u2019t made of money. The app is so simple. I just add funds from my debit card onto GoHenry and I can add any amount to my kids accounts anytime and it posts immediately into their accounts. I can even block funds if they\u2019ve had a bad behavior day. I would recommend this for parents. My kids are 13 and 9. It seems the perfect age for this app.  I\u2019m going to use this app long until my kids are adults. Thank you GoHenry!",

My primary complaints are that it\u2019s difficult to re-draw (return to your bank account) the money you hold in your gohenry parent account, and certain businesses that sell alcohol (some restaurants/etc) sometimes fail to process transactions because gohenry deems them \u201cadult businesses\u201d. I appreciate the safety aspects of that feature for kids, but it can be a hassle for my teen.",

In regards to the over 18s merchants, they have to legally classify themselves as over 18s due to selling cigarettes or alcohol on the premises and as the GoHenry card has a teen chip implemented by Visa, it automatically blocks these transactions. However, this usually only applies to small corner shops or newsagents and we recommend the child withdraws some cash from a nearby ATM if necessary. We appreciate this can be frustrating and apologise for any inconveniences this may cause. - Eisha \ud83d\ude0a",

        "comment_content": "UPDATE: As expected, the company replied to my negative review almost immediately. At the same time, I had to wait on hold for an hour to get someone at customer service on the phone. That person and their supervisor attempted to blame my daughter and the vendor for not scanning the card properly. They attempted multiple times and multiple methods and couldn't get it to work. The vendor had no difficulty scanning anyone else's card though (not a GoHenry cards, obviously...there is a reason nobody else has heard of them or used them). They wouldn't even address me telling them that I couldn't transfer money from my bank or to my daughter's card during the same time (there was apparently something wrong with their processing system but they refuse to admit it). I explained I had tried at least 20 times and it kept crashing. They couldn't see it on their side so they wouldn't address and implied that I did something wrong. Go read reviews in the app store, this site, BBB, or any where else they are reviewed. You will see similar reviews. This company is awful. Their service is terrible and their customer service is even worse. RUN! (END OF UPDATE) ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:Awful awful experience. This is the worst, most unreliable debit card you could dream of. Dropped my daughter off somewhere last night, she ordered food where she was, it came, she tried to pay and couldn't. She called me, I went to the app and she had more than she needed, but I still thought I should try to add more...that wouldn't work either. So the app and card were not working and would not do the one thing they were supposed to do...make payments. I tried to call or chat, but their customer service is 9-5pm only. Even if it was open it wouldn't have mattered because I am on hold while typing this and have been for 35 minutes and only gone from 12 to 5 in the queue so I would have had to pick her up before I got someone on the phone. Beyond that every 10 seconds or so their hold recording comes on to try to get me to use the chat, email or FAQ so they don't have to answer my call.This is not the first issue I have had with them. I have had a problem where my daughter couldn't pay her sit down restaurant meal (you know...when they bring you a check after you have already had your meal and incurred the cost) because they consider that an \"alcohol establishment\" and don't allow them to use the card. So it is really comforting knowing that they are protecting my child by putting her a potentially dangerous situation when she can't pay for the food she ate. I didn't ask her not to be able to pay at \"alcohol establishments\" but what I, as her parent, want is superseded by what GoHenry thinks would be best for my child. What you have here is a broken system where the debit card and app are unreliable (I have never actually heard of a debit card or credit card just not working in the first place) and the customer service is awful. They need to choose either bad products or bad customer service but they can't have both.",

Talking to you enabled me to discover what had caused this issue and gave me some area's that I have followed up on too, but it also enabled me to show you some areas from the app that will certainly help you identify why a txn has declined in the future.  I hope that our conversation was helpful and that your daughter enjoys her \"lunch on us\" as an apology for any distress caused.   Leslie      Hi AS - I am so very sorry to read of your recent experience your daughter had using her card to pay for her meal, we would never want one of our children to be in this position, so I would really like the opportunity to look into this further for you to see what the reason for this was, but I am not able to see your email address in your TP review to enable me to locate your account - In order for me to find your account, would you please send us an email to help@gohenrycard.com and in the subject please put - for the attention of Leslie - I can then trace this quickly and act on this asap for you.It is possible that it was due to the Merchant setting themselves up with over 18's merchant code on their card reader, as you had experienced once before -  due to our cards having a Teen chip, any retailer that has set themselves up as an over 18's merchant, the card would decline.  The Teen chip works really well to protect our kids and to give our parents peace of mind that the wrong purchases are not able to be made by a child, however we do recognise that in some circumstances, it would be helpful for our parent to be able to  to override this, and so we are currently working on developing this option from within the app.I look forward to receiving your email very soon, so that I can look at what happened and help you and your daughter to avoid this situation going forward.

Our service provides a secure way for families to pay their child's allowance, and help them prepare for the future. Whichever service you & your family decide to use, we fully hope that your family benefit from it. Please do let us know if we can provide further information or assistance. ~Sally ",

We just wanted to give somefurther information in regards to our fees and why we have these to give some clarity so I hope this helps.The charges passed on to parents for GoHenry membership is to simply keep the service running.  We believe the unique features of our website, apps and card provides families with flexibility and convenience to manage money together and to help their children learn valuable money skills that will help them through life. For us, this makes the \u00a32.99 monthly subscription charge great value for money.Where there are fees that fall outside your monthly membership subscription, it\u2019s because we are charged by our banking partners for the service they provide to authorise and process our payments. Due to regulations (PSD2), we needed to make some changes to ensure that all our members were being treated equally when topping up their accounts. We provide our customers with one load per calendar month which is included in their subscription. To avoid any service charges, we advise that customers load their parent account once a month with all the weekly allowance, task money, and monthly fee needed for that month. However, where we can we have covered certain banking charges and we work to keep any charges to a bare minimum.It is always disappointing to lose a member but we genuinely need to make the charges we do in order to be able to offer the service we do and to ensure we are able to deliver the best in digital money management to our members.We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your membership. If you have any further queries, our Member Services team are available 7 days a week from 8am to 8pm on 0330 100 7676 or at help@gohenry.co.uk. - Ellie :)",

We are really sorry to hear you are wishing to close the account, I have checked and we havent recieved any correspondence to close the account as of yet and th accountis active so the fees are being deducted.

I can see this has now been switched off so there will be no funds applied automatically due to this feature unless it does get switched back on. We do require a debit card/bank account to be always linked to our services as we our a monthly subscription service. So please do make sure there is $3.99 on the parent account for the monthly membership fees as this can be pulled automatically if they are overdue your billing date is the 1st of every month.

The option to schedule tasks and pay a reward in any amount I choose was just what I was looking for. The app is easy to use, even for my 6yo and my 11yo has been using the goals feature to save up for items she wants to purchase. The super cute personalized cards make the whole thing even better. If you are on the fence about it, my advise to you is just do it!! It is absolutely worth it. 10 out of 10 stars!!!",

Its totally up to you as the customer whether you pay tips or not, but in some cases tips are deducted. Often times these tips are authorised and processed alongside the transaction, sometimes tips are compulsory and taken in the same way.This uncertintity can cause some issues when processing the payment. To combat this GoHenry adds 20% to the transaction temporarily, to ensure that if tips are claimed they are accounted for as part of the payment. If they are not claimed the extra 20% falls back into your account when the transaction finalises. Sadly if the extra 20% isnt in the account the transaction will fail.  We would advise members to just ensure the cards are loaded with the expected amount plus 20% should the child shop or eat at a beauty salon or restruraunt. I hope this helps- Elaine ",

We have a few hundred dollars tied up in there and was told that it would be returned within 7-10 business days. So they canceled my account without telling me, I had to call to find out, and still have no info, and they are holding my money for two weeks.

One of my kids has ADHD and go Henry has helped him stay on task with his chores and create healthy spending habits where he can see what he earns, how he spends it and what he\u2019s saving. When I had my wallet stolen from me which had their cards in it, I was instantly able to lock their cards with just a quick click and Go Henry had new cards issued to them within a matter of 2 days! The customer service was very nice and helpful in a stressful situation. I highly recommend Go Henry to anyone!",

The money missions to teach kids about how money works are useful and my child is working through them. I hope that more missions will continue to be added as they were one of the reasons that I chose GoHenry. The savings goals and tasks to earn money are great. We could use a few more icons to represent our goals and tasks and be able to customize them. While I like that GoHenry includes an option for m daughter to give to the Boys' and Girls' Club, the limitation on the amount and the fact that there is only one charity to choose from are frustrations for us. My daughter initially suggested $5 per week and was very disappointed to learn she could only give 25 cents per week through GoHenry. While she willing contributes to other causes independent of GoHenry, we do hope that GoHenry will expand the options for charitable giving to include more charities and at much greater amounts. All in all, the app is pretty easy to use and we like the flexibility of moving the money were we need it on the spot. I have recommended the app to friends and will continue to.",

It told me to go to an atm that has that option.  So I used the search parameters on the link go henry provided. Drove 30 miles to that specific atm go henry said would do that function,  to find it would not work. Called go henry and was told it's not possible to change thr pin if you live in the US. So it's been a huge waste of time and money.",

The option below only allows for two parents total to assign tasks and check them off. So that means only one parent in each house can actually access the account. And no, stepparents aren't \"relatives.\" We're parents, and we help guide the growth of our kiddos, too.",

To be able to add a co-parent, all you would need to do is follow the steps below:- Log into the parent account via the mobile app- Click on 'Add a co-parent' which is in the left menu of the mobile app. - Share the link via SMS, Email or any other method supported by iOS or Android. The invite will be valid for only 14 days. - The co-parent can click on the invite link, and they will be asked to download the mobile app. - When the co-parent opens the app, they will be guided through a registration process. Here they will be asked to enter their email address, and their personal information. - After completing the registration, co-parents will be automatically linked to the family account. They will be able to log in using their own email and password. Hope this explains how to add a co-parent, however if you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact us again! - Nuria",

We love that we can send the link to other family members for gifts, can set up tasks for him to earn money, can separate savings, and introduces our son to giving. We have even sent gift money from the tooth fairy. Our son loves the customized debit card and is so proud to have a card \u201cjust like a grownup.\u201d We highly recommend!",

        "comment_content": "This app really helps me in my efforts to teach my daughters about financial literacy. They\u2019ve learned how to be responsible, how take into account how much money they have available to spend before they spend. For instance, my oldest had to learn the hard way one time. She went to pay for her items at Walmart only to witness her card being declined. Sadly she was quite embarrassed. I had to reiterate to her the importance of knowing her financial standpoint prior to making a purchase. I explained that it\u2019s better to experience this as a child than when she grows up. Needless to say she never made that mistake again. Moreover, with the spending limit settings it aids me in teaching them about spending in moderation and making a decision about what items are right now items. Sometimes we have a belief that everything is a right now need just because we have the money. Nevertheless that is not the case. The saving feature is really great as well. Although I had to lock the savings because they would move money from the saving just because they wanted a particular item. I\u2019ve been guilty of that as well, because growing up I didn\u2019t have anyone to teach me about finances, aside from being cheap. Being cheap doesn\u2019t mean you are financially literate. When you have goals intended for your savings you have to ensure that your not just freely taking money out of your savings merely because you WANT something vs you urgently need something.",

The ONLY complaint I have is that I wish you could create a task and be able to mark it daily if it\u2019s a daily task to help keep up with whether it\u2019s been done. Other than that which is absolutely not big enough to dislike the app, it\u2019s been fabulous. The price is kinda high in comparison to Greenlight which is 4.99 a month for up to 5 kids. And here we have 3.99 per kid. So with 3 kids it\u2019s a little pricey. I love the learning missions for the older kids so they can earn rewards and learn. I love that you can defer some money to savings and some to charity.",

When we received the card I was having a hard time activating it.  When I finally called I was informed that they were having trouble activating cards and I would receive an email when the problem was rectified.  To my knowledge I didn\u2019t receive any communication that the problem was rectified and therefore went with another card company.  I called and closed the account on June 10th.  I was told by the representative at that time that my request was processed and I should receive my money in 7-10 business days.  I call 2 weeks later and speak with another rep only to find out that I missed an email (sent 2 days before call) requesting my banking info.  Provided my info and again was told I would receive my money in 5 business days.  Called back this morning only to be greeted by am automated message that they are closed for a conference and will only be responding via chat 2-5 and will return to \u201cwork\u201d on Friday.  By mid day I received an email that says my request had been processed and my money would be received in 3 business days.  The problem with all the calls is when the reps tell you they have \u201cprocessed\u201d your request it hasn\u2019t been.  Because after every call I would receive an email so many days later basically stating YOUR REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED which it was not processed as all reps stated when I called.  So here it is now, June 29 and I have still not received my money from my closed account.",

When we looked into this, we discovered there was an issue and we worked very hard to resolved this for all members that were affected, however there were a few cases  that did take us longer than we had hoped to resolve and so you called us on June 10th to cancel your account.  I am really sorry that this issue meant we lost you as a member of ours, that is certainly not what we would wish for.  Once your account is cancelled, we sent a confirmation of our cancellation process, advising that the balance will be back in your account in 7-10 working days and so the latest you would expect to see your refund would be around June 24th.  We sent you an email on June 16th requesting your bank details, as due to the large amount being refunded, we were not able to send it back via your debit card details.  Unfortunately as you had not seen this email, this delayed the payment back to your bank even further.  Whilst you were able to give us the details needed on June 22nd, this initial delay together with our conference, unfortunately has meant that your refund will be received a week later than initially advised.  I am truly sorry for our part that was played with this delay, however I can advise that this was processed on the 29th and so should be with you either today or tomorrow.  Please accept my sincerest apology for any upset that this would have caused you and your family.  Leslie",

She had lost the card so I locked the account when the balance was $33.10. I reached out and asked them to cancel the account due to the lost card and issue a refund. I needed to have the refund sent to my new account which was not on file..Months go by, emails are NOT responded to, until about a month ago. Which I was informed it would be canceled and $13.10 would be refunded. Where the hell is my other $20? Because the lack of your horrible customer service you all are keeping $20 from fees on an account that was suppose to be canceled MONTHS AGO!!!!! So about a week ago I get another email saying my account is now closed and I will get a refund of $9.10. So pathetic of a company that is suppose to encourage kids to spend and save wisely you keep $24 for an account that was suppose to be close MONTHS AGO! I have requested to hear back from a supervisor multiple times, and I have NOT received a response back. I will never do business with scamming company known as GoHenry. You all are horrible! Lack customer service skills! I will continue to email until I receive a supervisor response and my full refund issued back to me!Pissed off parent Kristi",

Please see section 4 \"Our Fee\" - https://cdn.gohenry.com/site-furniture/amp-us/pdfs/Website_and%20Mobile_App_Terms_of_Use_v6.1.pdfAfter taking a look into your account I can see there was insufficent funds when we tried to collect the monthly membership fees for May for all 3 children and due to the insufficient funds in the parent account we did charge the debit card registered to the account. I can see the account is now closed and we did close and return all funds in your account within our 7-10 days cancellation process. I have followed up with an email with a screen shot of your statement and the full amount that was in there when closed and the refund letters to show this was all returned.

The cards can be used at ATM online and in store. You can set limits to the cards. They also have auto saving and you can set the limit to however high. And about 10 yrs out. The have a chore list where kids can earn extra money. Only thing is I'd like a daily list. Right now they have weekly and one offs but not an automatic daily. Their customer service is awsome and no long hold times. They are also very understanding and patient with you. In all this is a 5 star service. My family and I love it",

There are a few instances when you may see a pending transaction amount that is higher than the amount you spent.This is normally due to a hold put on purchases for tip oriented retailers or certain transactions. For the following types of transactions, you may see a pending transaction amount that is 20 percent higher than the total you spent, until the retailer settles your final bill, which usually happens by midnight on the day of purchase. The extra funds do get returned to the child\u2019s account. We do this to avoid the child\u2019s account going into a negative, as the child might decide to give a tip and if there are not enough funds in the account, it will make the account negative. The places this might occur are:Restaurants that accept tips/gratuity (note: pending transactions higher than the amount you spend will not occur at Fast food restaurants)Barbers and Beauty shops that accept tips/gratuityHealth and Beauty SpasLimousines & Taxi CabsHotels & MotelsIf you have any questions in regards to this, please do not hesitate to give us a quick call to (877) 372 6466 or at help@gohenrycard.com. - Nuria",

Evidently, she can go inside to pay in the \u201cadult store\u201d, but not at the pump.  I understand it is a safety feature, but I wish I was allowed to approve certain locations such as this, because I would much rather her pay at the pump, than have to go inside where I feel she is even more likely to encounter people with bad intentions.

After a week of using gohenry, I suddenly wasn't able to transfer money to my son's account. It said insufficient funds, but my funds were fine. Contacted customer service 3 diff times, no one could tell me anything, or how long to fix the problem, only that its being worked on and they would reach back out. After 2 weeks of the issue I decided to put more funds on the account because my son's auto weekly allowance still worked and the funds were down to about $4.00. When I added more money it seemed to fix the glitch, I was able to transfer money to his card again myself. I was happy. For a week it worked. But now again, once my funds gets down to around $20, its doing the insufficient funds again and I cannot transfer any money to my son.  Mind you I still haven't been contacted by them at all from reporting the issue almost 3 weeks ago. So I am canceling on Monday and will try out Greenlight. Really a shame because I loved gohenry.",

I would really like to have a look into this for you before you decide to cancel to see if there is anything we can do to bring a complete fix on the account. If you do give us a call, there should be a supervisor that can help and have a look into this for you. Again I am really sorry on the issues you have had when using GoHenry. -Elliot",

My kids loved the courses and learned a lot.  Thank you for designing a tool to build financial literacy!Also, the tasks need to be more flexible.  I had to create a weekly spreadsheet with each of their tasks that need to be completed on a daily basis so they could check off what they completed and what they get for completing the chore each day.  Then at the end of the week they get paid for what was completed.  It would be great to set up a more flexible approach on tasks to design a weekly or monthly calendar with their chores and how much they get for completing each one on a daily basis.Lastly, the login feature online via the app vs accessing via a web browser does not synchronize quickly.  If I change the password via the web browser it is not recognized by the app and vice versa.  Nonetheless, I love the app.  It is very progressive, informative, and needed!  Great job!",

I am glad to hear you are enjoying the app, the allowance is something that does come out weekly, if you wanted to adjust this, you can do it at any time by going onto the GoHenry app, clicking on the child's card, and clicking 'allowance'. You are able to change this at any time. If it is easier, we have something called 'tasks'. This is something that can be used to assign children certain tasks, which if they complete, they will receive the money in which you have set. You can find this on the same page as the allowance! Regarding the $3.99 that will be taken out monthly, your curent billing date is the 1st of every month. If you would like to change this, please get in touch and we can change this for you! I hope this helped. If you have any questions, please get in touch! - Louis",

When you request money back from your GoHenry account to your bank card; as soon as we process this, it is sent straight away, but it is then dependent upon when your bank to credit your checking account and this typically takes 2 to 3 working days for them to process the credit.I do apologize for the wait times on our phone lines as people usually prefer to contact us this way. We are always trying to improve this process and our customer support is ever expanding and doing their best as much as they can. Alternatively, we are available to support you in other ways.

After seeing some commercials about GoHenry on TV, I decided to check it out and felt it was the best one out of the others that were being offered because there were no fees and it seemed easy to use. So far it\u2019s been great. The app is fun for her to set spending and saving goals, she\u2019s enjoyed the informative money games the app has offered, and she has a debit card to take with her when she goes to dinner after school sports instead of bringing cash, and it\u2019s just been great!",

Sadly as I have no contact info to follow up with you personally, I can only advise as below:Setting up an account in someones elses name can only be achieved if the person setting up the account had access to all the relevant personal details. This includes the persons name, date of birth and address. Gohenry always checks the infomation manually input at the point of sign up against a number of databases to confirm the existance of the person and that the info input is valid. I think we need to know more about what happened here to advise you as best as we can. If I can ask you to kindly get in touch with us as soon as possible by email help@gohenrycard.com or live chat, with you full name and address we can hopefully delve a little deeper here. Our phone lines are currently closed, so best to get in touch via Live chat for a faster response. I have prompted Trustpilot to request some more info from you too, just so we have done all we can to ensure that this is looked into - Elaine ",

They have their independence and I don't have to worry about them begging me for toys or whatever in stores anymore. If they don't have the money, they can't buy it. It has really taught them both a lot and I don't thing these lessons would be teachable any other way. These cards have saved me money despite the monthly cost. My kids are 7 and 10. I don't think it's ever too soon to start this. They can learn the value of money at pretty much any age. I'm a huge fan of Gohenry. I recommend it to everyone!",

I can see that you advised us of the email address that you sent your referral to did not use the link and we can not see a link that you sent to the email address that you advise us of either.  However, I have located another account for the same friend that did use a referral link, but has not loaded or activated that account yet.  As per our terms and conditions, once the account has loaded and the card has been activated, then the bonus will apply to both accounts.  Please do ask Robert to log into the correct account, load and activate and you will both receive the bonus.  I do hope that this helps, but I will also follow up in an email for you.  Leslie",

I am aware of the issue you have experienced and as advised by our Agent, as a new card was ordered due to the previous card being lost or stolen, nothing can move in or out of this account until the new card has arrived and been activated.  I am sure that you understand that when a card is reported as lost, we do need to ensure that our members' money is safe, until you are able to access the account with the new card.  However this must have been so distressing for your child on Christmas day not to receive his gifts from family, so please pass on our apology to him as well.  Please be assured that I can see the money waiting to apply to the account, so once you have activated the new card, Jason will see the Gifts and the messages that have been sent too.  I do hope that this information and the call from a Supervisor has helped to put your mind at rest.  Leslie ",

For the following types of transactions, you may see a pending transaction amount that is 20% percent higher than the total you have spent, until the retailer settles your final bill, which usually happens within 48 hours from the day of purchase.The places this might occur are:Restaurants that accept tips/gratuity (note: pending transactions higher than the amount you spend will not occur at fast food restaurants)Delivery ServicesBarbers and Beauty shops that accept tips/gratuityHealth and Beauty SpasLimousines & Taxi CabsHotels & Motels*Please note, hotels & motels often hold money longer than 24 hours, and it may take up to 30 days for them to release their hold on your funds*After this time-frame, once the retailer claims the funds and they do not charge the 20% service rate, the funds will be released back into your child's account. This is to protect the child account from going into a negative balance at any time.If there's anything we can help with or you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us on 877 372 6466 - Ryan :) ",

We have three ways for your child to receive their weekly allowance.  1 - set up the allowance to automatically pay each week, you can either tick auto top up so that our system debits your bank when we need to pay your child, or if you dont tick this, you would need to ensure that you have the funds in your account 24 hours before we are due to pay your child.  You can also set up tasks, so that one you tick them, they will pay on pocket money day.  Or you can just pay your child manually as and when you need.  Alternatively you can have a combination of all of these too if you wish.  To set up either tasks or allowance, just click onto your childs name, then cards then earnings. Our cards can be used in many countries, but please either check the website or call in to find a detailed list of the few countries that the cards cannot be used in.  I hope this helps.  Leslie",

Before gohenry we, like most families had a chore chart & allowances you could earn for completing each task. Although it worked good for the 1st month. After that no one seemed interested in even looking at the chore chart or even cared about receiving allowance. Until now. Thanks to gohenry. It\u2019s really helped keep him interested & excited about helping out & earning allowance in the process. As well as teaching him how to manage his earnings & the best way to save or spend them. He says that \u201chaving his own debit card with money on it that he actually worked for is so cool & way more fun than our dumb chore chart\u201d. gohenry has made it so simple for parents to add or transfer money to or from their child\u2019s debit card. As well as monitor what he\u2019s spending his money on. I recommend gohenry to anyone who would like to teach their children how to use, manage or save money using a real debit card.",

In our opinion, their business practices are not inclusive and don't take into consideration children with physical or cognitive challenges.I am editing this review because the reply that gohenry added is totally off base and not relevant to our concerns. This had nothing to do with being locked out or needing a PIN reset. Perhaps the gohenry employee has us mixed up with someone else.  I am not surprised. It seems they can\u2019t even get that right or take responsibility for their actions.Again, we do not recommend gohenry.",

We are very much an inclusive company and do cater to different needs for our children, indeed our app has a lot of tools that Parents can switch on or off, depending upon how they wish their child to use our service.  I understand that your concerns are around the pin number and your son not entering this correctly and then being locked out of his account.  If the pin has been forgotten, then the correct pin can be advised from both the child and parent app.  However I am sure you understand that we do need to ensure that our members money is safe, so if the wrong pin number is entered 3 times, then the card is locked and you would need to call us, so that we can ensure the card is in the right hands and then we can easily unblock it for you over the phone.  I hope that this information is helpful, but if not and you wish to go through anything else, then please do call in and ask to speak to me, I will be very happy to help.  Leslie",

There was not a calendar but rather we had to input each chore with a day of the week label on that chore. There were not options to decrease the amount of money that we give each task. At least not a reasonable option. Closing the account was easy. We just had to call. Although days later we received an email stating we had to give our bank information to receive the balance. Feeling uneasy putting that information in an email, we had to call back. When we called back even days later because of our busy schedule. We asked why did they not request that information when we closed the account. They had some lame answer that they only close the account and cannot see that information but they can pass on the information to the correct department to process our refund. What? So after giving them our bank information they said it would take 7-10 days to process. Here we are still with no refund. We called again today since our children are getting anxious about not having their hard earned money. They apologized and stated it should take 2-3 more days. So early next week? The saga continues. Stay clear of gohenry. Their customer service team are pleasant enough especially with their accents but it doesn\u2019t matter when all we want is our money back.",

In relation to our tasks feature, you can create your own tasks \"other\" and set the amount to a minimum of $0.50 upwards. However if you wanted to give your child less than this, you could set a weekly allowance as low as $0.01. Our cancellation process is 7-10 days. The reason for this is to allow any pending purchases to fully clear before remining funds are processed back to the account holders nominated bank account. Sometimes our payments team do need a bank account to transfer the funds to when this happens they get in touch to ask for this. when we have this we process it as soon as possible and then the turn around time is two days, this is usually the minimum amount of time it takes your bank to receive the files and process them. I have popped you and email in relation to your refund specifically. -Elaine ",

That's not helpful. If it is going to pay a bonus, that's great but not if it gets eaten each month by fees, which is what happens. There are others of these which are free. They don't pay as much on the incentive end but they don't charge each month making it a much less painful & enjoyable acct to set up for my grandson.",

Your best option is Greenlight! GoHenry also never refunded the remaining balance in my account due to me filing a dispute. What did they expect?This company is going to either file bankruptcy soon or fail to the dirt; as they should.Update: They sent me an email inflicting defamation that i never submitted the requests to them to cancel.

The rating should be a zero instead of a 1.I seen the advertisement for Go Henry on television and I thought this would be perfect for my kids to learn how to budget and save money for their futures. I applied and was approved for this Go Henry account for my kids. I waited over a month and I never received any cards or anything else in the U.S. mail. I attempted to call customer service a significant amount of times and no one ever picked up the phone. Terrible customer service. In my opinion, this is another typical fly by night bank and I will do business somewhere else...!",

Phone support was useful as breasts on a cactus. After being on hold for 15 mins, automated voice informed me that I would be disconnected and to contact them via email. DO NOT INSTALL!!!!!!!!

And I am really saddened to hear Yo have a negative experience with our customer service team. I do apologize. Perhaps I can help?When you top up the gohenry parent account the funds go directly to the parent account This acts as a holding pot for funds. To enable you to set up chores and tasks. The funds are not available on the Childs account to be spent until you use the quick transfer button on the home page to then load the card. Once you have done this the funds then will be ready for spending on the card.(its a two step process from loading to moving the funds to the card for instance access) If you would like to give us another shot we would happy to offer Ruben a free custom card.

We believe the unique features of our website, apps and card provides families with flexibility and convenience to manage money together and to help their children learn valuable money skills that will help them through life. For us, this makes the $3.99 monthly subscription charge great value for money.Here are some of the reasons we believe gohenry offers great value for money: Parental controls: our service offers children independence whilst the underlying control still sits with the parent to allow them to guide by setting spending limits and selecting where the card can be used.Mobile notifications: both parents and children can receive real time notifications of any spending, available balances and reasons for declined transactions - keeping you both informed every step of the way.Online and mobile access: gohenry provides online and mobile banking, while most High Street bank accounts do not offer this service to anyone under 16.Contactless card: our card enables your children to enjoy contactless payments. Tasks and chores: ability to set up tasks and chores for your children to earn extra money.Savings goals: because it's not all about spending, goals to save for that special something can be set up to help motivate whilst educate!Giftlinks: friends and family can gift money to the child for special occasions like birthdays and Christmas, or send a one off gift for anything else - send via a customised e card direct to the child with a choice of design and personalised message, child can then send a thank you backSupport 7 days a week: We are open 9am-5pm EST, 7 days a week and ready to help.gohenry incurs charges for each and every transaction we process via our third party partners and, whilst we try our best to absorb as much of these as we can, inevitably some of this is passed on to our members.We hope this gives you a better insight into the membership subscription charge.  If there are any of the features mentioned that you are unsure of or need a helping hand with something then please be assured we are here to help.

        "comment_content": "Overall, we like the app and my 13y daughter has been more motivated on chores and extra jobs now that she can flash a debit card in front of her friends.  The reason for 3 stars is the frustration level of setting up repeating chores.  The current options for types of chores are weekly and one-time.  I wanted to make mornings better (every morning) so I had to create a one time chore: Monday, get up 1st try, make bed, brush teeth.   Tuesday, get up 1st try, etc.  7 TIMES.  She has other daily goals/tasks that she may or may not complete so I had to do EACH of those 7 TIMES.  If you could make a chore that repeats daily I would give you 5+ stars.  That being said, I have recommended to friends with the above caveat.",

The customer service hours are very limited to it\u2019s almost impossible to get help. And lastly, gohenry members can\u2019t send gifts to other card holders. Example: I have my two children on my account, my sister has a card for her son on her account. So on her sons birthday she sends out a gift link. Since my children have cards they want to send their cousin a gift for his birthday but the system prohibits it. They don\u2019t allow gohenry users to send gifts to other members. I would not recommend this card to anyone else. We\u2019re looking into switching them to another company with less restrictions and a place that has less glitches and tech issues.",

For tip-orientated merchants, there can be a pending transaction amount that is 20% percent higher than the total you spent.

This usually happens by midnight on the day of purchase and is to prevent the child's account from falling into a negative balance.

We believe the unique features of our website, apps and card provides families with flexibility and convenience to manage money together and to help their children learn valuable money skills that will help them through life. Features such as our parental controls, transaction notifications, contactless payments enabled are a few of the things our members find invaluable in supporting their children\u2019s digital money management education.

The only transactions which will incur an additional charge are ATM withdrawals, which are charged an additional $1.50 plus the fee of the ATM provider and transactions to establishments that customarily charge a tip. When the card is used in establishments where tipping is the norm, such as restaurants, hair salons, nail bars, etc, 20% will be added to the amount of your child's transaction, when the funds are preauthorised and this is to prevent the card from going overdrawn if the retailer were to claim a tip. If they do not, the additional 20% will be released back onto your child's card when the transaction 'settles' which is usually within two to three days.Having looked into your account, I can see that your child has made one online transaction on their card and this did not incur any additional charges. I can however see that the monthly fee for your child's account for March was debited from your linked checking account on the same day, so this may be the cause of the confusion. I have sent you an email with some further information. Please do get in touch if you would like to discuss this further, or, if there is anything else we can assist you with. - Iliana :)",

You can find more information regarding adult retailers here: https://us.support.gohenry.com/us/s/article/Why-am-I-being-told-my-transaction-is-not-allowed.Having looked into this further for you, I can not see any declines on your children's cards due to the retailers being listed as over 18 merchants, but can see that the cards have been recently declined due to insufficient funds and the spending limits on your children's accounts. I have sent you an email with some further information regarding the declines. Please do let us know if you have had any further issues using the card and we will be happy to help!

Otherwise, we love it and it has been a fantastic motivator for our child!Thank you!",

I don't mind doing it manually but errors saying I have insufficient fund when I have $60+ are unacceptable. When I submitted a ticket they responded saying that the allowance was paid so all was okay. No. It is not okay. My money was missing and I had to manually issue allowance.

It's so easy and the aesthetic is great - my 10 and 12 year olds really enjoy using it, and so do I.  5 stars, hands down!",

We review all feedback received to ensure we learn from the times when we don\u2019t quite get it right and can take any corrective action to ensure we make the changes needed. It seems when my colleague asked for your date of birth, the information given was incorrect, which was why we were unable to verify you as the account holder in order to discuss your account or make any changes to it when you called.  Whenever you contact us, we do need to verify your details so that we ensure we are speaking with the account holder and not anyone else in order to discuss the account. This will be why we would ask for your full name, your date of birth (as the account holder), your zip code, and an additional security question selected. This is the information that you have provided when signing up for the account.  I can see that the card was not activated before your account was cancelled and without activation and the initial loading of the account,  then the Childs card will of course not work.If you still wish to have a GH account, then please do sign up again, ensuring you enter your personal details in correctly, then once you have made your first load and activated the childs card, you will be able to fully utilize our service.  I hope this was helpful, but if you do need to discuss this in more detail, then please do give us a call and we will be more than happy to do so.  Leslie",

They haven't take anything out yet but just thinking about it can happen got me kind of nervous. My son is in his room right now asleep and someone is in his account trying to take money out at an ATM machine in New York City how's this possible when he has his card and his wallet. I get alerts all the time when money's been deposits and when money's been distribute to all my kids account. This is scary I had to lock his car tonight so nobody could go into his account. Parents be aware the card is not protected seems like it's not safe like a credit card. Safe from scams scammers out there. My kids go online and buy things from Amazon and Roblox.

The information used to verify the details at account sign up centres around the account holders, rather than the child, so there is very little information that we hold on our accounts around the child's information.    I also apologise that your call to us earlier this month did not resolve this issue.  As discussed just now, I have taken steps to ensure that this account is closed and I will follow up with an email once this has been completed.  Leslie ",

GoHenry has given my child confidence in using her earned money for things she wants. I feel it's more convenient to add money to her card than to give her cash to spend. Having the option to customize the card was a lot of fun. I've needed to reach out to customer service multiple times through the phone and through chat and the reps I spoke to each time were very helpful, polite, and informed. I would've liked to pick the PIN. It took my child a bit of time to remember it but over all it wasn't too big of a deal. I would love a daily task option, where the app would show only the tasks for that day, and whether they are checked off or not, the next day would have the same tasks again. This would come in useful for tasks like brushing teeth, and getting ready for bed, etc. We can't wait to see what new features GoHenry provides!",

She is unable to count or add but can read numbers so I thought having an app where she could read the total amount and compare to the price of what she wants to buy would be a solution.   This app has been amazing!  The visuals are great with large numbers.  The line graph for the items she is saving for is perfect as it helps show more vs less.  The instant transfer is great.  I also love how I can transfer back to me if I need to give her cash instead.  She doesn't quite understand the giving yet but we set up to donate to the boys and girls club weekly so she can see it happens anyways and may eventually understand.  Adding chores is easy and she often does a chore that I add on.  Overall great app that helps her learn life skills and helps me be more organized about teaching them))",

There may be a work around for this, but it wasn't obvious or easy to implement at a quick glance.Other than that I like how I can keep track of his spending.Great offering overall.",

To turn the allowance off manually please  login to your parent account on the website or app and go to 'Earning'. Click the pencil icon next to 'Weekly allowance' and update the amount to $0. For the cancellation to be effective for the same week, remember to update the allowance amount before 6pm the day before your weekly allowance payment day.

I have now responded to your email- Elaine Updated reply - I am sorry this is still causing you some problems Madison.  I think I can see the issue.  You sent your email to our UK customer services and as a different database  is used, Elaine could not find your account and so asked you to confirm some security details in order for us to trace your account.  This is very simply resolved, as I suspect you are trying to log into our UK website, which is why your password will not be recognised.  Please log into www.gohenry.com/us and  you should then be able to use your current password - if however this still does not work, doing a password reset from the correct website will work.  I will follow up with another email with this information, to ensure you are aware of the issue and can access your account without any further delay.  Leslie",

I have tried to call you to discuss, but had to leave you a message on your voicemail instead.I can see that you signed up to your account on the 14th January and your card was due to be delivered on the 25th January.  I can confirm that this has been despatched, however due to Covid, USPS are experiencing some delays with their postal service, so we do advise our members to wait a few days after the delivery date, just to ensure it does arrive, as ordering a new card too soon, can cause you further delays and we try very hard not to disappoint our members.  At this point however Jeremy, it is very overdue and so a replacement card does indeed need to be sent out to you.  I have sent you an email with some more information, so if you would be kind enough to reply back to me as soon as possible, I can then organise a new card to be despatched to you without any further delay.    LeslieUpdate 19/02 - Hi Jeremy, I have been keeping track of your card that I re issued for you and I am so pleased to see that it has arrived today and has now been activated.  If you need any information on how the account works, then please don't hesitate to call us.  Leslie",

Upon talking to 3 different people from customer support, they told me there was nothing they could do to change the address on my account without it first being activated. I can't activate it in the first place. When I waited a few days to talk to the bank after the MLK holiday to change my address, the bank changed my address, however, the GoHenry card still wouldn't process my debit card. I tried a credit card with the billing address as the same address on my son's Go Henry account... and still, nothing worked. He was so excited to get his card so he could start making his own purchases. I was excited too. I wanted this to work but now we're left with a card that won't even activate. It's just sitting here... However, it is a pretty neat design. I'll find something else.",

When signing up, our application does request your home address, so that we can pass you through our identification checks.  The address for your bank card also needs to match your  GH address too, as this is a security feature that ensures the safety of our members cards when loading.  I can see that the new cards have been despatched and should arrive to you around the 23rd January and you have already been successful with your first card load, so you are almost there - once the cards arrive, you should not have any more problems.  I hope this helps.  Leslie",

I have called customer service twice. Both agents were extremely kind Amd tried to help but no luck. I also had to contact my bank and change my address on my bank account to match where i had the cards delivered. I have emailed them back and forth with no help. So now i have to call again. Once i called they were closed when it said they were open and it disconnected me. Then the second time i waited on hold and the system cut me out. Needless to say I still haven\u2019t resolved and honestly I\u2019m skeptical to transfer any moneySo... i will keep updating so other will know. I received their email with the same information I was given several times and I gave them the same response several times. So no it didn\u2019t resolve anything.So it\u2019s now almost a month after getting card... no resolution and no responses. Still tough time getting anyone on the phone. I have decided I will no longer give my bank info. GoHenry is a no Go for me:(",

I have tried to call you and left you a long voicemail with the information that I can see and I would ask that as you have changed the address with your bank and you have not attempted to load again since the 8th January, that you try again today, as the changes you made with your bank two weeks ago should allow your payments to be processed.

I understand from your call on Friday, that you had auto top up switched on and the agent you talked to explained how this worked, switched it off and requested a refund of the extra money in your GH parent account.  I can see that she also followed this up with an email to confirm that this refund can take 2 working days to show in your parent account.  As your refund request was late on Friday evening here, the \"working\" day began on Monday, which is when there refund was processed by our payments team and so you should receive the credit to your account today, being the 2nd working day.  All retailers have merchant codes set up on their payment machines and so as the GH card has a teen chip, transactions will not be allowed to be processed if the merchant has classed themselves as an over 18's retailer, so both yourself and GH cannot override this decision in this instance.  Whilst I am sorry that this has caused you some concern, I do hope that the information our agent provided you with both on the telephone call and the follow up email was helpful in understand what happened and what she was able to do to help you.

Therefore to have an account with us you would have signed up using the address on your state ID and drivers licence. As we have verified you to that address we will not be able to change the address until we have verified that you live there. We do this by asking you to activate the child's card and add funds using a debit card registered to that address. If you do not live at the address matching your state ID and drivers licence we will ask you to update your documents and sign up again. I can see you were able to add funds to your account but not yet activated the card. I have sent you an email to address this further. -Mya",

But if you ever have any concerns in the future, please do give us a call, as we are aware that mistakes can be made and we would never penalise a member for this - just a quick call and we can always put this right for you :-)  I have credited the extra card fee back onto your parent account now for you.

However I have noticed that you have not yet activated, so what you may be seeing for your first load is the first load needing to be $9.99, this breaks down to the first load of $5, that stays on your parent account to do what you wish with and $4.99 to pay for the custom card that you purchased for your child.  I hope that this helps, but if you have any other questions, then of course please either give us a call or pop over an email as we are always happy to help.  Leslie",

I found this app and gave it a try. I was able to customize the card (would be nice to have more options) but we both have the app, where I can monitor his activities and he can keep tab of his spendings. \u201cI feel like an adult\u201d he said lol He has set up his goal to save every week. It teaches him to be responsible and complete tasks that i add as bonus to his allowance. The app is easy to use for both of us. Customer service was amazing in helping me get set up and going. PS: I referred my sister last week to start one for my godson and I received my $10.00 for the referral and so did she \ud83d\ude0a which made me very happy because although most companies say they will give you the credit, I usually have to call in and hunt them down. But this was automatically added to my parent funds. I had forgotten to add funds to be paid to my son because I am not enrolled in auto pay as yet by choice, so that $10 was helpful. So far, so good I\u2019ve been using gohenry for about 3 weeks now and I have no complaints.",

We believe the unique features of our website, app and card provides families with flexibility and convenience to manage money together and to help their children learn valuable money skills that will help them through life. Through us, parents can closely monitor spending through real-time notifications each time the card is used and can limit how much the child can spend per transaction, per week and per ATM withdrawal whilst children get the freedom of a bank card and access to their own online account to save money and monitor their spending. For us, this makes the $3.99 monthly subscription charge great value for money. If you have any questions or issues do not hesitate to contact us. Our Member Services team are available 7 days a week from 9am to 5pm EST time on (877) 372 6466 or at help@gohenrycard.com. :) -Nuria ",

We believe the unique features of our website, app and card provides families with flexibility and convenience to manage money together and to help their children learn valuable money skills that will help them through life. Through us, parents can closely monitor spending through real-time notifications each time the card is used and can limit how much the child can spend per transaction, per week and per ATM withdrawal whilst children get the freedom of a bank card and access to their own online account to save money and monitor their spending. For us, this makes the $3.99 monthly subscription charge great value for money. If you have any questions or issues, do not hesitate to contact us. Our Member Services team are available 7 days a week from 9am to 5pm EST time on (877) 372 6466 or at help@gohenrycard.com. -Nuria :)",

Through us, parents can closely monitor spending through real-time notifications each time the card is used and can limit how much the child can spend per transaction, per week and per ATM withdrawal whilst children get the freedom of a bank card and access to their own online account to save money and monitor their spending.

With regards to topping up your account, each time you add money to your parent account, you will receive an email to acknowledge this load and it will be sent to the email address registered to your GH account.We appreciate your feedback about adding another parent, this is something we are already developing!-Mya ",

We are a pocket money service rather than a bank, so where banks earn their income from interest rates, our only income is from our membership fees. This allows us to maintain the accounts. The gohenry card gives parents the opportunity to load money into the child's account, set spending limits and weekly tasks to encourage them to do their chores i.e.\"earn their money\" as well as teaching them to save for something specific to them. This is all relevant to what we all currently do in our adult life. So we think it's a valuable lesson to teach our children to manage their finances from a young age towards the digital future. We do understand that this isn't for everyone and regardless we are glad to hear when a parent has found something that works for them and their family.-Pedro",

In the meantime, I usually set up a Task  for each day of the week, simply called Monday through to Friday, then you can write the description next to what you need your child to do.  If you set this up as a weekly task, you can go in each week and change the description, if say you don't want them to tidy their room on the same day they did it last week.  You can do this by clicking on the pencil next to each task, from your parent account. I hope this helps-Beth ",

As our cards carry the teen chip they will automatically decline in independent stores(that can serve alcohol and tobacco), corner stores,liquor, tobacco stores that have an over 18 merchant code. This code enables them to serve over 18 products. Any larger stores such as Walmart are authorised to serve alcohol but do not carry the over 18 merchant code, they are strictly regulated and must check ages of the customers buying in stores, So therefore the card will work in all stores like Walmart.

After reading your review I am little confused about what has been happening. I have attempted to locate your account and the only account I can find is an account that is not yet activated. If I can ask you to kindly email us or call us we will be able to take a look into this for you, in more detail.  help@gohenrycard.com (877)372-6466Our accounts are run by parent account holders for their children. It is the parent account holder who sets tasks/jobs for the child account holder to achieve. In order to qualify for the funds that are attached to each job or task they must be ticked off by the parent account holder or child depending on how this is set up.  If you are referring to someone else paying you for a job, this is not something we accommodate.  In order for funds to be placed onto a child account they must come from the parent account holders debit card. or via a gift link that is sent via the parent account holder to the person wishing to \"gift funds\" Please do get in touch with us so we can figure this out for you and offer you the best advice going forward. Kind regards, Elaine :)EDIT: That is absolutely no problem at all Joshua, happens to the best of us. As ever we are here for you should you need us. All the very best to you and your family- Elaine :)",

        "comment_content": "I had a horrible customer service experience today. I tried to create a new account and was told my identity was unable to be verified. Usually this is an easy fix and thought they may just need me to provide proof of verification. I started a live chat to determine how to verify my identification and provide any proof needed and was not even assisted I was just repeatedly told that I \u201cfailed the verification process and could not have any services with their company\u201d. I assumed the live chat may have been a bot so I called the customer service phone number and spoke to a representative. It was not of anymore help. I was again told I \u201cfailed the identification process as my name and address do not match my social security number. I have provided them with all of my legal and accurate information and have not run into any issues with any other financial institution. I then asked the rep if there was a way I could provide proof of my identification and was told \u201cunfortunately not and we cannot provide you with our services\u201d. This was just an absurd experience and I have never had a company just deny their services without a clear explanation of anything I could do to continue the sign up process. I have not provided them with any false information everything was my legal and accurate information and I\u2019ve had no issues elsewhere. I was also denied when I requested to speak with a supervisor. Beware before doing business with this company that this is what their customer service is like!!!!Edit: to add in reply to the reply from Gohenry. What I\u2019m trying to explain to everyone involved is that ALL off my information is accurate and up to date on my ID. Everything matches! There is nothing different from the information given and my legal information/ID. Something was clearly done incorrectly on YOUR end as I\u2019ve had no other issues with this at my current financial institution or any other place I\u2019ve needed to present this information to. However you are not even allowing me to provide proof ofMy identification just saying \u201cno We cannot provide you with services\u201d. There\u2019s NOTHING I can do on my end because as I said I am registered with my correct information, my ID has all of the correct information, the social security department has all of my correct information. There is nothing that should be conflicting. Something was done wrong on YOUR end!!! However you won\u2019t even attempt to work with me to resolve this like any other company would such as allowing me to submit a copy of my ID, Proof of address or anything like that just giving me a blanket statement of \u201cwe will not provide you services because your information doesn\u2019t match\u201d. NO I absolutely will not attempt to sign up in the future because your customer service is horrible.Edit to reply: Yes I have read your email and you are telling me that I need to go get my drivers license updated. This is NOT helpful because it is UP TO DATE. It has my current legal name on it as well as my current address. You are also saying it is a temporary ID which is untrue. It is the current Drivers License required by and issued by the state of Ohio. Good luck running a business when you turn away eager and honest customers.",

When you want to experience a service and see how it works but are not able to get over the first hurdle it can be really disappointing. Here at gohenry want to welcome everyone who wishes to use our service for what it is intended for. We believe every child should have access to an education in money management. Making it easier for people to access our services is something we feel very strongly about and we are constantly looking at ways to improve our customer journey and sign up process.  As a financial service, we must adhere to the US patriot act and as such,  we are obligated to \"know our customer\".As part of this we run background checks at the point of sign up, to verify your identity. Sadly if you do not pass this check or the information that you have provided does not match up to your state ID or drivers licence we simply cannot verify you and would not be able to offer you an account at this time. There are simple things you can do to enable you to sign up in the future, such as ensuring your State ID and drivers licence is up to date and reflects your current residential address, ensure you are on the electoral role and registered as such at your address.  I can confirm I have located your account and we are now currently in the process of looking into this in more detail for you and we will be in touch ASAP.  Again I do apologise for any distressed caused by our sign up process. All the best, Elaine :)EDIT - Hi there, I have looked into your application and have sent you a detailed email with the reasons you have not been able to pass our online Identification and the changes you need to make in order for us to be able to verify you.  I do hope that this helps to explain but if you need any more help, then please do let me know.  Leslie",

When loading the parent account, as the bank card is logged on the parent account, all money must be paid directly into the parent account first, as you have full control of each load.  You can of course set up an automatic allowance to be  paid to your child each week.

We first started in the UK, 7 years ago and we were set up for parents by parents as there was nothing around at the time to help us teach our kids great money habits.  We have successfully grown in that time and decided to launch our service in America.  Our American service is fully regulated in the US, our bank is CFSB and all accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000.  Our customer service is in the UK at present, as this is where the expertise on our service is at present, but we will at some point be moving this over the US as well.
